<BR><B><P>July 5, Thursday:  Lake Superior 2007.</B>
<BR> * Have we packed everything?
<BR> * Miriam and Adonis, Merle and Derek.
<BR> * Two folding kayaks, camping gear.
<BR> * Loaded into the Caravan mini-van.
<BR> * Ferry, Tobermory to Manitoulin Is.
<BR> * Camping late on Manitoulin.

<I>D184-006 07-07-05</I> - <B>Cooler than expected?</B><xxx>

<BR>   We catch the Manitoulin ferry at Tobermory. This transition
always signals to me that we're leaving southern, and particularly, urban
Ontario behind. But the handy campsites of yesteryear, north of the ferry
terminus, turn out to be few and far between.

<I>D184-007 07-07-05</I> - <B>Leaving Tobermory harbour.</B><xxx>

<BR>We stop at Batman's Tent and RV Park, arriving at 10pm after a long drive
north from South Baymouth.  Seems to be nobody home. A light in the distance.
Adoni goes inside the camp office. Chatty proprietor appears. A large trailer
is in line in front of us, also chatty. Adoni tries to speed up the process.
The rest of us sit in the car and hear mutters of distant thunder.
<BR>

<I>D184-009 07-07-05</I> - <B>Little did they suspect.</B><xxx>

<BR>Rain in the air. Drizzle as we put up the tents. I can't figure how to insert
the poles into the tent sleeves in the dark. Merle's headlamp is a godsend,
otherwise we'd have been totally stymied. Miriam and Adoni finally show us
how to do it. Haven't felt this stupid in a long time.

<I>D184-011 07-07-05</I> - <B>Shipboard characters, gossiping about us.</B><xxx>

<BR>I'm glad nobody but family members are watching. We get the tent pitched,
bedding arranged, and climb into the sleeping bags. Then discover we're
perched on the edge of a ditch and on top of deep tire ruts that we couldn't
see in the gloom. We pull on our underwear, stagger out into the dark and
drag the tent and its contents sideways. Finally achieve a reasonable degree
of comfort.
<BR> The weather calms. No more thunder. A frog glug, glug, glugs all night long.
Loons in the distance. I wake several times but remain comfortable.
<BR><B><P>July 6, Friday.</B>
<BR> * Wakeup, Manitoulin Island campsite.
<BR> * To Lake Superior Provincial Park.
<BR> * 15 km access off the Trans-Canada.
<BR> * Camping on the beach.

any further problems tent pitching in the dark.

<BR>Next, 50 kilometers of gravel side road off the Trans-Canada Highway. An hour
of slow driving. In places you have to drive carefully to get around large
rocks sticking up in the middle of the road. You might need the car's
crankcase later on to get you back to the main highway. And make sure you
check ahead with MNR on the status of the road and the campsites on the Lake
Superior shore. No park officials are stationed on the beach. Campsite
reservations have to be made at the nearest provincial park with staff
on-site.

<I>D184-023a 07-07-06</I> - <B>Fishing boat visitor, Gargantua Hbr.</B><xxx>

<BR>We arrive at Gargantua Bay, 5:30pm. Almost a kilometer of sand. An island at
the mouth of the bay with a navigation light. We unload gear at the boat launch.
But the shore at that point is boulder-strewn. So we have to carry everything
from the car down to the sandy part of the beach.

<BR>Next, we ferry one kayak, unassembled and loaded into the other, plus extra
gear, down the beach. This kayak is being reassembled opposite our selected
campsite. We get set up in time for a bite to eat and a campfire. Mosquitoes
are ferocious. Have to slather on plenty of DEET repellant.

headwinds, a light swell coming in from the lake, verging on whitecaps when
turning back into Gargantua Bay.

<BR>The sandy bottom near our campsite changes to huge boulders as we paddle
south. Down the coast, on the left side of the bay, as you look toward the
open lake, are ocher, grey, and reddish cliffs. Fantastically broken in places.
But in some spots, smoothed by wave or glacier action. With layers, mixed,
and twisted, as in a Bartram print.
<BR> We paddle south in off-and-on sun against a stiff breeze.

<I>D185-047 07-07-08</I> - <B>Rockscape #1.</B><xxx>

<BR>We get the kayak into a narrow cleft, not enough room to turn, have to back
out. One or two "bathtubs" down here. Perfect for skinny-dipping on a hot
afternoon. This would be a prime spot for a picnic lunch away from our camp
on the beach.

out on the northerly point at the entrance to Gargantua Bay.

water has that same wonderful blue green that you see in old ship portraits.

<I>D185-051 07-07-08</I> - <B>Difficult place to land</B><xxx>

<BR>  We paddle back to the car for supplies. I practice an over-the-side exit.
My semi-waterproof pants are a partial success. A real farmer-john wetsuit,
tighter fitting, would probably be better. Give the paddler a feeling of
being master of the elements. Better able to control the landing. Kayaks are
particularly difficult to get out of, or into, with dignity. This is due to
the low sitting position as much as to the tippier quality of kayaks.
<BR>
<BR> I prefer to go over the side at waist level water depth, when landing the
kayak on a problematic shore. You can guide it in, ease it past rocks, steady
the boat while a passenger climbs out. Besides, our hull is made of fabric.
You really do have to be careful.
<B><P>July 9, Monday.</B>

<BR> We set up on a low sand dune at the head of the bay. With a view back south
towards the mouth of Gargantua Bay where we started out and which is now
concealed by a fog bank. More shelter here, more offshore islands.
<BR>
<BR> A late lunch after about one and a half hours paddling to get here.
Travelling a little lighter now. We've carried some supplies back to the car
before setting out this morning. Now we can't easily go back to replenish our
stock. We're committed.

<BR>Merle and I paddle to this ochre-mining island. We slide along beneath high,
sheer cliffs. Something about certain slabs of rock that gives me an almost
religious feeling. Almost? OK, I admit it. Actually gives me that feeling!

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D186/D186-019.jpeg">
<I>D186-019 07-07-09</I> - <B>Surprising colours.</B><xxx>

<BR>An elusive intuition of the core of being. Masses of rock sometimes have that
numinous quality. But it's difficult in everyday life to experience something
that is present everywhere, but masked by a thousand other details and
preoccupations. Rocks, mountains, lakes, rivers, and open skies help blow
away the dust.

<BR>The mouth of Gargantua Bay is faintly visible here, south, beyond the
islands on the centre and right horizon.
<BR>
<BR> I'm now sitting on the sand in of those pinch-your-bum, lightweight camp
chairs, writing up my notes. Hardly a chair, but it does give the back some
support. Hard to get enough of this scene. Keep gazing and gazing. A fishing
boat drifts down near the mouth of Warp Bay. Bird songs all around. Every
treed island seems to have its own voices. Miriam is off gathering firewood.
<BR>
<BR> If alone I'd try to talk Merle into taking her clothes off for some sand and
skin pictures. Probably use the old reliable "artists' position" to avoid
serious familial embarrassment.
<BR>
<BR> Would come up here again. Plan a more extended but leisurely route. Not sure
if the old inland canoeing haunts of yesteryear quite compare to this. Well,
yes, OSA Lake does, for instance. But the openness of this place, the larger
scale is impressive. In the space between two islands, you see open water for
a hundred miles or more.
<BR>
<BR> Contrail of a plane heading south. I recall similar
observation while on our Puskasaw hike, of at last being far, far away from
the rat race.

<BR>The letter is dated July 1st, 2006. A year and 4 days previous. How's that
for Nature imitating fiction. The "pitiful fallacy" as Tanya Moldauer once
said in my Richard Peters novel.
<BR>

<BR> * To Marathon to recuperate.
<BR>
<BR>Today we have to head back to Gargantua Bay. Rain this morning gradually
tapers off by about 9:30 am. Breakfasting, we listen to marine radio weather
forecasts: small craft warnings, but with a westerly or north-westerly wind.
An <I>onshore</I> wind, no chance of getting blown out onto the lake.
<BR>
<BR> Our kayak is
half buried in the beach. We left it too close to the water's edge last
night. Pounding waves have kicked up water weeds and sand. We dust it off,
pack and leave by noon. Tail winds, and a significant swell coming in from
the lake. 
<BR>
<BR>We're sheltered by offshore islands until the approaches to Gargantua Bay.
Here the swells are huge and some waves reflect off the shoreline cliffs
creating a criss-cross chop. Welcome to white water kayaking on Lake
Superior.  At one point we're nearly surfing.
<BR>
<BR> In the troughs of the waves you
can't see the shore at all. Up on the crest you have a fine view. Paddling
conditions are too hectic and spashy to leave off paddling even for a few
seconds, so I get no pictures this leg of the trip. The worry is that I'll
lose control. Then kayak will turn sideways and capsize.
<BR>
<BR>We take a couple of rollers over the side while landing on the beach. Surf
pounds me and the kayak, as I do my over-the-side wet landing. But I manage
to stay upright while unloading Merle and other, less essential gear. Miriam
and Adonis have already landed. Eventually we all get packed up and and
loaded into the minivan. On the road again. Memo to self: don't get caught
between a loaded, wave-pounded kayak and a steep shoreline.
<BR>
<BR>An hour's drive on the beach access road to get back to the Trans-Canada
highway and then north to Pukasaw National Park. Camping at Hattie Cove, then
into Marathon town to recuperate.

forcasts. And mostly the pessimistic forecasts, at that.

<BR><B>July 5 Thursday</B>   We camp at Batman's Tent and RV Park. Arrive at 10pm after
a long drive north from South Baymouth on Manitoulin Island.  Seems to be
nobody home. A light in the distance. Adoni goes inside the camp office.
Chatty proprietor appears. A large trailer is in line in front of us, also
chatty. Adonis tries to speed up the process. Rain in the air. Drizzle as we
put up the tents. I can't figure how to insert the poles into the tent
sleeves in the dark. Merle's headlamp a godsend, otherwise we'd have been
totally stymied. Miriam and Adonis finally show us how to do it. Haven't felt
this stupid in a long time.
<BR>  Get the tent pitched, bedding arranged, and climb into the sleeping bags.
Then discover we're perched on the edge of a ditch and deep tire ruts. We
pull on our underwear, stagger out into the dark and drag the tent and its
contents sideways. Finally achieve a reasonable degree of comfort.
<BR> The weather calms. A frog glug, glug, glugs all night long. Loons in the

Then on to Espanola for a real brekkie. Wonderful place opposite the OPP
station. Buy another headlamp at the Canadian Tire store. Just in case of any
further problems tent pitching in the dark.  Onward to the TransCanada highway.
<BR> Arrive at Gargantua Bay 5:30pm. Amost a kilometer of sand. An island at the
mouth of the bay with a navigation light. Unload at the boat launch. But the
shore here is boulder-strewn. We carry everything from the car to the sandy
part of the beach. Ferry one kayak, unassembled and loaded into the other,
plus gear, down the beach to our campsite. Set up in time for a small
campfire. Mosquitoes ferocious. Slather on DEET.

to Warp Bay in the kayaks. More lovely campsites. Back against headwinds,
light swell from the lake, verging on whitecaps when turning back into

<BR> A lazy afternoon beachcombing. We find a steamboat wreck in Gargantua Bay,
paddle over and around it, taking pictures.

<BR><B>July 8 Sunday</B>  Mixed weather, rain in am. DGF, read. Afternoon, paddle south
in off and on sun against a stiff breeze. A slight swell coming in from the
lake. Refreshing. Invigorating. The water has that same wonderful blue green
that you see in old ship portraits. Sandy bottom near our campsite changing
to huge boulders as we paddle south. Down the coast, left side of the bay as
you look toward the open lake, ocher and grey cliffs. Fantastically broken in
places. But in a few places, smoothed by wave or glacier action. Layers,
mixed, twisted, as in a Bartram print.
<BR> Get the kayak into a narrow cleft, not enough room to turn, have to back
out. One or two "bathtubs" down here. Perfect for SD on a hot afternoon. This
is a prime spot for a picnic lunch away from our camp on the beach.
<BR>  We paddle back to the car for more spplies. M and A paddle round the island
at the mouth of the bay. I practice an over-the-side exit. My semi-waterproof
pants a partial success. A real farmer-john wetsuit, tighter fitting, would
probably be better. Gives the paddler a feeling of being master of the
situation. Able to control the landing. The kayaks are particularly difficult
to get out of, or into, with dignity. This is due to the low sitting position
as much as to the tippier quality of kayaks.
<BR> I prefer to go over the side at waist level depth when landing the kayak on
a problematic shore. You can guide it in, ease it past rocks, steady the boat
while a passenger climbs out.
<BR> Haven't decided yet what to do tomorrow. Tonight is our last night paid
for. Miriam has a sore hand from a fall on the rocks walking on the
northerly point at the entrance to Gargantua Bay.

<BR><B>July 9 Monday</B>  Decamp Gargantua Bay beach for Warp Bay. Camp on a low sand
dune at the head of the bay. A view back towards the mouth of Gargantua Bay.
More shelter here, more offshore islands. 
<BR> A late lunch after about one and a half hours paddling to get here.
Travelling a little lighter. Have carried some supplies back to the car. Now
can't easily go back to replenish our stock. We're committed. After lunch
another paddle north out of the bay toward Gargantua Point. We don't quite
make it before the time runs out. Will try again tomorrow.
<BR> Merle and Derek paddle to an ochre-mine island. Sliding along beneath high,
sheer clifs. Something about certain slabs of rock that gives me an almost
religious feeling. Almost? Actually! An elusive intuition of the core of
being. Masses of rock sometimes have that numinous quality. But it's
difficult to experience something that is present everywhere, but masked by a
thousand other details and preoccupations. Rocks, mountains, lakes, rivers,
and open skies help blow away the dust.
<BR> I'm now sitting on the sand in of those pinch-your-bum lightweight camp
chairs. Hardly a chair, but it does give the back some support. Hard to get
enough of this scene. Keep gazing. Fishing boat down near the mouth of Warp
Bay. Bird songs all around. Every treed island seems to have its own voices.
Miriam gathering firewood.
<BR> If alone I'd try to talk Merle into taking her clothes off for some sand and
skin pictures. Probably use the old reliable "artists' position" to avoid
serious familial embarrassment.
<BR> I'd come up here again. Plan a more extended but leisurely route. Not sure
if the old inland haunts quite compare. Well, yes, OSA Lake for instance. But
the openness of this place, the larger scale is impressive. In a space
between two islands, open water for a hundred miles or more. Contrail of a
plane heading south. Similar observation while on the Puskasaw hike of at
last being far, far away from the rat race.

<BR><B>July 10  Tuesday</B> Threats of weather on the marine radio. Decide to try for Cape
Gargantua this morning. Cloudy dull, an easy paddle. "The devil's chair" has
two holes pierced in the back, reminding me of a two-holer outhouse seat.
I'll bet the voyageurs called it the Devil's Privy or some such. Back to Warp
Bay against light headwinds after inspecting the available campsites at the
cape. Visit a beach with black sand that looks volcanic.
<BR> Turns out after we get back to camp, that M and A were
hallooing at us from the cliff top of Cape Gargantua. They had
walked overland via a coastal trail.
<BR> After lunch, we all go on a hike to Cameron Bay, three kilometers north of
the campsite. On the beach we find a memorial cross and a message in a
bottle. How's that for Nature imitating fiction. The "pitiful fallacy" as
Tanya Moldauer once said in my Richard Peters novel. We open the bottle for a
closer look and then...
<BR> Then it begins to rain, heavily. All the way home and all night, with a
brief respite around campfire time. Which we start the hoser way, with
gasoline and much huffing and puffing. When we arrive at the campsite
our tents are awash in a small lake. We move everything sideways to higher
ground.

<BR><B>July 11 Wednesday</B>  The Rain gradually tapers off by about 9:30 am. Breakfast,
marine radio weather forecasts, small craft warnings, but a westerly or
north-westerly wind. Our kayak is partially buried. We left it too close to
the water's edge last night. Pounding waves have kicked up water weeds and
sand. We pack and leave by noon. Tail winds, a significant swell from the
lake. Sheltered by offshore islands until the approaches to Gargantua Bay.
Here the swells seem huge and some reflect off the shoreline cliffs creating
a criss-cross chop. Welcome to white water kayaking on Lake Superior. We take
a couple of rollers over the side landing on the beach. Surf pounds me and
the kayak, as I do my over-the-side wet landing. But I stay upright unloading
Merle and other, less essential gear. Eventually we get packed up and and
loaded into the car. On the road again.
<BR> Tonight, camped at Hattie Cove in Pukaskwa National Park, site

<BR><B>July 12 Thursday</B>  Rain. In again to Marathon for lunch at a cute deli.
Shopping, Can Tire, groceries. Back at the campsite, we walk round the point.
Even in the rain, lush, interesting rocks, many wildflowers we can't
identify. Have neglected to bring our wildflower ID books. What an oversight.
<BR> Supper, soup. More walking. The sun is back. Pictures on the beach. Looks a
good spot for a kayak launch. Weather radio promises good karma for tomorrow.
<BR> The showers are hot, says Merle, but take the handicapped stall, more room.
Sips of rye whiskey at dusk. Even the mosquitoes are loveable. Desiderata:
Derek wants a warm fuzzy hoodie for warmth and to keep the mosquitoes off his
neck, a water bottle like Miriam's, and the spray skirt for the kayak. This
would have been good yesterday if he'd remembered to bring it, although the
cargo might not have fitted underneath.

<BR><B>July 13 Friday</B> (the thirteenth) Blue sky today. Kayak assembly, we portage
from the tent site to Horseshoe Bay's sandy Beach. We're on the water before
lunch. A brief exposure to the outer lake, then in through a narrow channel
to Hattie Cove. This is a shallow lake, loons, ducks, water lilies. Lunch
sitting against a log on a sandy beach. Cool but comfy if you hunker down
beneath the breeze. 12 degrees Celsius.
<BR> On further south to Pulpwood Harbour down the coast. We paddle round a
sailboat anchored. Appears deserted, but probably sleeping in, having sex
or preparing a delicious breakfast of bacon and eggs.
<BR> We attempt to reach Playter harbour, the next indentation south down the
coast. A heavy swell from Superior that I find exhilirating. Adoni and
Miriam have more sense and turn back. We relent and follow. Another frisky
entrance to Horseshoe Bay, but no difficulty landing. We carry the kayaks
back to the tent site. In to Marathon town for dinner. Early to bed. Rain
begins again at 9pm.
<BR> Desiderata: a wind shield for the camp stove, platypus water bottle, new tent,
Starfleet communicators that actually communicate. Ours only picks up
the marine radio weather forcasts. At this campside our Eureka tent zipper
becomes so badly jammed that I have to cut my way out of the tent with a
knife. A hasty repair with a sewing awl at least gives us our basic shelter
back again.

<BR><B>July 14 Saturday</B>  Hiking today. We reach the White River suspension bridge in
three hours, ten minutes. A very damp and woodsy trail. Lake Superior
rainforest. Sunny spells. No rain but wet leaves brush against our clothes.
<BR> The river is surging. The bridge is a thrill. Probably worth three hours of
hard slogging to get here, even with three more hours on the way back. Our
campsite of yesteryear was several kilometers upstream from this bridge. Tired
when we get back,

<BR><B>July 15 Sunday</B> (a bit)  Risque d'orages apres midi. Love sick crows
fornicating in the tree tops. We later find that the peculiar noises are
being made by a young crow as it is fed. But to me it sounded like the throes
of corvid lust. OK, I was just projecting.
<BR> We're been saying lots of clever things in the last days. Does anybody
remember even one of them. I know I said at least three smart things in as
many days.
<BR> We get launched from Horseshoe Bay beach. Merle falls in, undaunted. Calm on
the open lake, apart from a smooth swell. Paddling north, we see a bald eagle
on a crag, nattered at by gulls. Serenely unperturbed, a superpower of the
avian world.
<BR> We paddle north under cliffs, around reefs and islands. I don't think I've
every had a more idyllic paddle. Back again across Horseshoe Bay, swells,
lovely. Water smooth, almost no wind. Sheltering to write this in a group of
islands opposite Hattie Cove. Still one and a half hours before the predicted
orages. What to do with our lives. Reflect.
<BR> Finished Mary Wesley: Part of the Furniture, yesterday. A favourite of
everything read in the last year. The plot comes full circle in a most
satisfying way. The plot of our trip is soon to come full circle.

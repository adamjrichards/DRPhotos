<BR>Wishful thinking has for many years kept me chasing the elusive goal of
combining words and pictures in a way that mimics the story-reading
experience of books. This has resulted in a collection of written
diary/notebooks, a few sketchbooks with interspersed notes, several decades
worth of photo albums with an after-the-fact attempt to add names, dates and
places, and finally with a computerised system capable of assimilating both
notes and digital pictures.
<BR>
<BR>Even this last has never quite become the fully integrated scheme of my
dreams. Note-taking, diary writing, and photography are, for me, different
sorts of activity, usually carried out in somewhat different moods or
contexts. Note-taking seems most effective in a reflective, after-hours
context, while taking pictures is something I'm inclined to do while active
and not thinking in verbal terms. Bringing both together to capture the same
moment at the same time has never been easy.
<BR>
<BR>It's difficult to write while you're manipulating photo equipment, equally
difficult to take pictures while you hold open a notebook or sketchbook and
wield pencils. There exist hybrid possibilities, such as a camera with
dictation capabilities, or a digital tablet with camera capabilities. So far,
I've found this kind of option either too expensive, or too clumsy for field
use.
<BR>
<BR>Generally, people seem happy to simply show each other current pictures and
talk about them without any elaborate attempts at adding permanent
documentation. Or even recording names, dates and places.
<BR>
<BR>Not me, I'm afraid. Like most people, I have low patience with ODTAA. Or,
ODPAA, <B>O</B>ne <B>D</B>amn <B>P</B>icture <B>A</B>fter <B>A</B>nother, and have spent years of my
life experimenting with IT systems to solve this problem. Initial attempts
took the form of synchronized sound 35mm slide shows, with a spoken word
voice track. These naturally required a prepared script to accompany the
pictures. A few examples follow. By converting these shows to web pages, they
can now be browsed on a tablet device. And this, in my opinion, comes closest
to <B>reading pictures</B>, that is, viewing images and text together in a
coherent, book-like context.

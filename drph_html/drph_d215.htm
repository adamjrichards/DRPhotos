<I>D215-011 08-09-09</I> - <B>Erie Canal, Brockport N.Y..</B><xxx>

<BR>We're on our way east to the Adirondacks and later Quebec. We take the
scenic route from the border crossing at Queenston. Brockport, on the Erie
Canal, suggests the possibility of a canal trip someday. Apparently, you
could travel all the way to the Hudson River and then north, through Lake
Champlain, and into Quebec.

<BR>Camping at Crown Point, we drive next day to Adirondack Loj,
near Lake Placid. Mount Jo, overlooking Heart Lake and Algonquin
Peak, is reputed to offer one of the most cost-effective climbs in the
Adirondack mountains: The best view for the least effort.

<BR>Some kindly fellow traveller offers to take our picture on the summit of
Mount Jo.   A smaller peak like this allows you to look across at the flanks of
higher mountains. The farthest horizons are obscured, but you can get a better
idea of the folds and undulations of the terrain, within a single day's
radius.

<BR>We ascended Algonquin Peak, 5114ft, back in 1996 via a trail that leads to
the right of that closer hill on the left, and up the valley. We returned to
our campsite via Avalanche Pass. This was a grueling 12 hour hike.
<BR> If you're viewing via the WWWB windows app, stop the slide show to see a
few pictures and sketches from 1986 and 1996, or to digress to our 2006 trip
to the Adirondacks.

<BR>We climbed Mount Marcy on our first trip to the area in 1986. Marcy Dam and
reservoir with its campsite lies behind the nearer hill on the right. From
Marcy Dam the trail is a long slog through the woods till you reach the rocky
shoulders of the peak itself. Mount Marcy is the highest mountain in New York
state, 5344ft.

<BR>We swam here in warmer weather back in 1996. The swimming area was crowded
with kids paddling and demure ladies in conservative bathing suits. On
today's date, September 10, all those demure ladies are busy back in
Poughkeepsie, New York, ferrying kids to and from school, piano lessons
and soccer practice. But today we're free to be rootless nature buffs.

<BR>The arrow probably suggest access to the hiking trail leading back down to
Lake Placid. We've heard about this route, but after two ascents of this
mountain by car, we don't have the heart for an anti-climactic ascent on foot.
We did do the ascent of Mount Washington on foot, years ago. Then years later,
went up via the cog railway. For maximum satisfaction, you have to earn the
right to a ride.

<BR>High Falls Gorge, near Lake Placid, is a commercial scenic area very similar
to Ausable Chasm south of Plattsburg. The walkways give a close and
intimate view of the rushing water and the potholes. Well thought-out signs
explain the geology and ecology of the area.

<I>D215-083 08-09-10</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Our Victorian forbears used to dote on these rugged beauty spots. Perhaps
partly because they conveyed a kind of natural morality. People
expected to experience a sense of awe and wonder, the sublimity of God's
creation. At one time we were even told we should <I>fear</I> God.

<BR>The catwalks, although totally artificial, permit you to view something
natural and dangerous that would be totally inaccessible otherwise. Perhaps
it's these contradictory qualities that make the experience interesting.

<BR>These holes bored in the rock were apparently created when a crack allowed
water to leak from one level to the other. Particles of grit and stones
carried by the flow of water then swirled down the channel gradually
enlarging it by impacts against the sides.

<BR>The first full day in Quebec is rainy. A visit is organized to an old
explosives factory where gunpowder was manufactured. The park area has an
interpretive centre plus the remains of dams, waterworks and the foundations
of buildings where the powder was prepared. In a few places you can see the
ruins of buildings that were destroyed in explosions that periodically
brought the operation to a standstill.

<BR>Even a relatively recent archaeological site like this would be difficult to
interpret, without the supplementary evidence of documents and photographs.
Because of the dams and aquaducts, it is clearly an industrial site, not a
cemetary or a temple. But how would we be able to tell what was manufactured
here. Gunpowder manufacture would likely leave no clear chemical residues
that could be analysed by later generations. Unlike metal smelting, for
instance.

field excercises by the army. Everything reuseable for the war effort was
recycled in those days. Metals, cardboard, paper, even fat left over from
cooking. Probably used to make soap or nitroglycerine.

<BR>Derek had a brief go at bonsai cultivation during his various botanical

<BR>Even this rock is a kind of mountain, a landscape in miniature. Something
like the summit of Mount Ham, you might think, although we climbers never
got to see it.

<BR>On the eve of a national election, our thoughts turn away from nostalgic
mountain climbs in the Adirondacks, meanderings in the daisy fields of the
Eastern Townships, and botanical excursions in Montreal, the city of Derek's

highway 407. A brief respite from freeways and parking lots, as we explore
the towns east of Ottawa.

<P>    Captain Fielding of the Fort Henry Royal Artillery was in a
difficult situation. But this time the problem was diplomatic
rather than military. The previous day, Paul had arrived home in
Kingston, dirty, ready to drop from exhaustion, and with
startling news of James' capture by the Americans. Nevertheless,
by mid-morning the day after, the Captain's response was already
taking shape.
<P>    Despite considerable banter from his superiors, he'd secured
permission for the diversion of a patrol vessel. On a tour of
the various guard rooms of the Kingston garrison, he'd picked up
-- not quite willingly -- an entourage. A company of horseless
dragoons on the way to rejoin their regiment at Quebec, plus
assorted naval cocked hats with no battles to fight. But these,
at least, would give the deputation a little of the martial
flavour that other nations had come to expect of the victor of
Waterloo. 
<P>    They'd sail the patrol vessel into the offing of Sackets
Harbor flying special flags signifying: "This ship wishes to
parley." Captain Fielding would then proceed by boat to the
inner harbour. Once in contact with the proper American
authorities, he would have to negotiate for the release of his
son with as much dignity as possible under the circumstances. In
the privacy of a quiet regimental office, he began his covering
letter.
<P>
<P>          To Colonel Chauncey Enright, Acting Commander of the
          U.S. Military District of Upper New York State:
<P>          
<P>          My dear Colonel,
<P>              A matter of some delicacy has been thrust upon us.
          I trust that you, as an officer and a fellow member of
          the Mystic Brotherhood of Freemasons, will see fit to
          give it your most charitable attention ...
<P>          
<P>    They'd first met in 1814 in the confused final stages of the
battle of Plattsburgh. As in the engagement at Sackets Harbor,
things had not gone well, though the British had been on the
verge of a victory. George "Granny" Prevost, the Commander in
Chief had, to quote some American wag, "snatched defeat from the
jaws of victory." Captain Fielding's own part in the affair had
also been somewhat embarrassing.
<P>    It was another of those stories of the war that he'd not
recounted to James in any detail. It was far too easy for the
young to become disillusioned with the folly of their elders
before they became immersed in folly of their own.
<P>    He stared up at a crack in the wall, meditating on his own
stake in the general foolishness of army life.
<P>
<P>    Fielding's Folly was to get captured when the war was nearly
over.  He and his men were ambushed by American sharpshooters
while moving an artillery battery into a strong but isolated
position behind the town of Plattsburgh. This was on an
apparently disused road where earlier scouting parties had
reported no sign of a picket. To their credit they'd rallied and
crouched behind fallen timber trading shot for shot like regular
skirmishers.
<P>    Then a troop of enemy frontiersmen rode up. They were
surrounded by backwoods riflemen stalking ever closer through
the trees. A commanding but careless sounding voice had
announced from hiding:
<P>    "Whoever's in command over there, I'll make you a deal.
Throw down your arms. The ranking officer surrenders, and the
men are free to leave." Yes, he would remember that voice to
his final day.
<P>    A canny move, brilliant even. The possessor of those
deceptively negligent tones well understood that a live
artillery company was precious little good without officers and
heavy weapons.
<P>    The position was untenable. Fielding had been convinced that
his company would all become pointless casualties in a futile
engagement. He shouted back:
<P>    "I agree to surrender, provided my men are allowed to
retreat in good order. But they must be allowed to take muskets and
side-arms with them. ... It is the only guarantee of safety they
have."
<P>    A moment's consideration, then the drawling voice again.
"Fair enough. Just so's you leave that fieldpiece where it
sits." 
<P>    "Agreed."
<P>    "Hold your fire, boys! We got the brains of the outfit."
<P>    Fielding removed his cap and waved it cautiously in the air.
No answering shots. Cautioning the sergeant in charge of the gun
crew to return immediately to the British lines, he got slowly
to his feet and turned in the direction of the voice.
<P>    A tall, sardonic officer with a shark-like grin stepped from
behind a tree. "Enright's the name. U.S. Government tell's me
I'm a colonel. Who may you be?"
<P>    Captain Fielding all too easily "escaped", only to endure a
court-martial on his return to British territory. It was a
relatively good-natured affair, but, as a consequence of his
defence -- which was basically to remind the court that he had
taken his own jolly old self off and left only an ancient and
probably hazardous fieldgun behind -- he was permanently tagged
with the nickname "Old Fieldpiece". The question of cowardice on
the field of battle was brought up behind closed doors, only to
be quashed in high places. However, he knew that his chances of
promotion, never good anyway, were now virtually nil.
<P>    The Captain continued to stare at the crack in the plaster.
Another meandering creek on the map of life, flowing out of a
wilderness, leading into a wilderness.
<P>    Worst of all was the burden on James. "Young Fieldpiece" had
been mercilessly ragged by adult and youth alike. And the fact
that Fielding senior was still generally well-regarded by
military and public seemed to encourage the teasing. After all,
if there was no real malice behind it, why restrain the urge to
get a laugh?
<P>    The boy, however, still brooded. He'd lately been guilty of
long, worrisome absences from home to go "exploring". This
latest excursion was only one of a series of risky adventures.
Undertaken, the Captain supposed, to exorcise his young man's
worries about being thought a timorous bookworm. Or perhaps it
was because he was, at sixteen, slight of build, a year or two
late going into his final growth spurt. Or, perish the thought,
there was some deeper disquiet. Even now, nearly a year after
the final cessation of hostilities, the American menace was
still alive enough to give the boy night terrors. That is,
<I>when</I> he was home and asleep in his own bed.
<P>
<P>    Fielding stared at the letter a final moment. He removed
from his hand a ring displaying the curious square and dividers
symbol, folded this within the letter, sealed and pocketed it,
and went out.
<P>    At the garrison lockup, he spoke briskly to the gaoler on
duty. "Corporal, I have an order for the release of the
prisoner Sullivan into my custody. Please see to it he is well
secured."
<P>    The corporal disappeared with a ring of keys into the inner
depths. While waiting, the Captain shared the anteroom with one
other person. This was a formidable sergeant-major of dragoons
who volunteered the information that he too was here to pick up
a prisoner. A certain wayward sergeant of his own regiment,
Garner by name, recently incarcerated for drunkenness.
<P>    "But that can wait till you've collected your own man, sir."
<P>    With much clanking of iron gates and the sounds of a brief
scuffle, the rumpled but powerful figure of Sullivan was dragged
into the daylight and fitted with manacles.
<P>    "Watch him, sir, he's a bad 'un," cautioned the corporal. 
The prisoner scowled in the unaccustomed glare. He fixed his
red-rimmed eyes on Fielding and broke into an unexpected smile.
<P>    "Ah, yer honour, an' how're his Britannic Majesty's troops
doin' this luvly marnin'?"
<P>    "Well enough, thank you, Sullivan. You'll be happy to hear
that your release is imminent." The Captain observed in passing
that the man's accent had an Irishness that was too theatrical
to be believed. 
<P>    "Now isn't that parfectly swate of you," oozed the prisoner.
"Sure'n I'll drop by rale soon for another visit."
<P>    "Most unnecessary, I assure you. We are quite capable of
managing our own political affairs, thank you very much." 
<P>    "So you'll not be needin' my assistance to set up a free,
democratic, and republican form of government, then?"
<P>    "I fail to see that possession of contraband and
communication with known agitators has anything to do with
legitimate politics," Fielding responded with some hauteur.  He
was feeling not a little apprehensive at the prospect of having
to escort this unpredictable individual on his own.
<P>    "Then you've a great deal to learn about modern affairs."
Sullivan lunged for the open door. Just as promptly, he was
seized by the sergeant-major, a commanding figure with a voice
that would curdle milk while it was still in the udder.
<P>    "At your service, Captain. I'd be most 'appy to be of
h'assistance. Sergeant Garner can bloody well dry out for
another hour or two." The sergeant-major cleared his throat and
put on his most penetrating parade ground voice. "Nah then,
prisoner. Right about, FACE. By the left, queeck, MARCH!"
<P>    He and the unhappy Sullivan, bereft of any audience
sensitive to sarcasm, quick-stepped out the door, heading in the
direction of the boat landing. 
<P>    "And who, may I ask, was that, Corporal?"
<P>    "Sergeant-Major Crocker of Dragoons, sir. His regiment is on
the way to Montreal. The talk is, they're to be disbanded when
they reach England."
<P>    "You don't say. Pity we could't find some use for a splendid
chap like that. Hmm ..."
<P>    The patrol vessel waited at the dock with the wind fair for
departure. Men stood by the mooring lines as Captain Fielding
had a discreet word with the master of the dockyard. A formation
of marines, resplendent in red jackets and pipeclay, was drawn
up beside the gangway. Their corporal strutted to and fro as
they awaited the signal to board. The ship's first lieutenant
greeted Fielding.
<P>    "Ready when you are, sir. Prisoner's been stowed in the
chain locker. Couldn't abide any more of his lip." He peered at
the crowd accompanying Fielding. "Expecting trouble?"
<P>    "None whatever. But just in case we need to impress the
Americans, it seems I'm to have a firing party of marines and a
full complement of staff." He dropped this remark a trifle
embarrassedly, pressing through the crowd of hangers-on and
glancing toward the bow. "Ah, I see you have two six-pounders
ready for service. Should be sufficient to get their attention
without creating an incident." Then, in a hoarse, confiding
whisper: "Oh, by the way, were you able to get that cask on
board?" 
<P>    "The keg of Madeira, sir? Yes, we did."
<P>    "Good, we may need some extra bargaining power at the
negotiating table." 
<P>    The lines were cast off and the ship drifted away from
dockside as the windage of spars and rigging took her into open
water. At length, sails were set and they steered a course to
clear Wolfe Island for the lake beyond.
<P>
<P>***
<P>
<P>    After a day and night of confinement, James had thoroughly
explored the narrow limits of his cell. No means of escape
occurred to him, short of an ambitious tunnelling project under
the floor. He'd have to labour for weeks with a rusty nail
merely to dislodge the mortar that held the bars in the window.
That morning he'd awakened to the sound of footsteps and
muttering overhead. Outside the window, a pair of boots went up
the alley. Then a door slammed in the direction of the stable.
The mind of the prisoner dotes on detail. No spider web, no
carved initial in the wall, no muffled shout can escape
elaborate analysis. 
<P>    Settling on his bunk for yet another brooding meditation, he
was disturbed by the clumping of feet on the basement stairs.
Perhaps the guard was bringing breakfast. Heels thudded across
the flagstones to the doorway of his cell. The pace was too
quick for any routine errand. A key probed in the lock. The
guard beckoned him out, indicating with a jerk of his head the
direction of the stairs. In the main floor guard room, he was
greeted by the Colonel who emerged from an inner office,
followed by a raffish-looking character named Cyrus, apparently
his <I>aide-de-camp</I>. 
<P>    "You look like you didn't sleep too well, son." He addressed
James with a combination of narrowed eyes and toothy grin.
"Today you're gonna have a chance to sample American-style
justice." The remark did nothing to relax the prisoner.
<P>    "But I've had no trial." James' mind raced to come up with
plausible excuses for what would certainly be viewed as
vandalism. If only he could anticipate the legal arguments they
would use against him.
<P>    "Don't matter at all. You'll get what's comin' to you
anyway, won't he, Cyrus. Now, c'mon along with me."
<P>    Cyrus remained behind. "Jist ta check up if they's any
floggin's, firin' squads, or buryin' details to attend to." He
leered knowingly at the prisoner and directed a fine jet of
tobacco juice into a spitoon.
<P>    They left the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters and headed
toward the town's premier hotel. In the dining room, the Colonel
turned to his guest. James took up a defensive position with his
back against the wall. 
<P>    "Any final requests, son? Eat hearty, cause it may be your
last chance." The Colonel was not smiling.
<P>    James opened his mouth to speak, a fateful vision of
retributive justice forming in his mind. Then the hotel-keeper
entered the room. 
<P>    "What'll it be for you, Colonel? And the usual whiskey
bottle for Cyrus, I suppose?"
<P>    "Not today, Sam. Cyrus is busy. My prisoner and I are gonna
have us a hearty breakfast, right son?  And bring me a good
sharp knife this time." Their host hurried off for food.
<P>    At the mention of a sharp knife, the prisoner's eyes went
wide. The Colonel sat yawning and scratching and idly looking
around the room while James tried to think of a dignified way to
plead for mercy. The hotel keeper brought cutlery, two plates
mounded with slabs of steak and fried eggs, along with a large
carving knife. The Colonel tried the edge against his thumb.
Then -- with a sweep of arm that fanned the prisoner's cheek --
flung the blade to stick quivering out of an exposed beam above
James' head. 
<P>    "Yup, sharp enough to do the job, I reckon. Here, hand me
down that pig-sticker, will you, son? Gonna need cold steel
where I'm going. Say, you ever learn to fight with a knife?"
<P>    "Cricket is my sport, sir." He knew it was the wrong answer
as soon as the words left his lips.
<P>    They breakfasted in silence. The Colonel punctuated his
steady mastication with the crackling of bread crusts torn from
the communal loaf. Their cutlery clattered on the plates in the
deserted dining room. James ate with elaborate care, on the
flimsy, but very schoolboyish assumption that a prisoner who
dribbled egg yolk down his chin was less likely to be accorded
lenient treatment than one who held his knife and fork the
proper way. Colonel Enright thoroughly relished the meal. He
cleaned up the residue of egg with a last scrap of bread which
he flipped accurately into his mouth from arm's length. Then, in
loving tribute to the cattle and fowl of Sackets Harbor, he
picked up the plate, passed his tongue over the surface till it
was spotless, and turned to James with an air of deep
satisfaction.
<P>    "That ain't ... scuse me ..." He gently belched away a minor
grammatical slip. "That isn't half bad, coming after a hard
night's sleep. Wouldn't you say, son?"
<P>    The Colonel withered his prisoner with a fixed stare. James
was stunned into silence at the too-obvious paradox of a colonel
in the U.S. army licking his plate clean. Was the man teasing
him, playing cat and mouse? Surely the mere act of trespassing
didn't deserve a really severe penalty. On the other hand, he was
convinced, like the majority of his fellow Upper Canadians, that
the war was merely in abeyance.
<P>    "May ... may I ask what you intend to do with me, sir?" 
<P>    "I was just figuring that out. Fact is, I'm pretty sure I'll
be able to give you exactly the treatment you deserve. Y'see, I
met up with your old Daddy once before. I already know what kind
of folks you Fieldings are.  Him 'n I've still got a little
score to settle." Pushing his plate aside and wiping his lips on
his sleeve, he called for the hotel keeper. "Put that on the
Government's bill," he demanded as the proprietor emerged from
the pantry. 
<P>    "I've been meaning to ask, <I>Mister</I> Enright, exactly when
the Government intends to honour its commitments?" A sarcastic,
civilian emphasis on the word "Mister" caused the Colonel to
raise his eyebrows. 
<P>    "Just soon's Washington sends me the money," was the equable
answer.
<P>    "I'd be glad to pay for my own breakfast." James made the
offer in his brightest, most helpful manner. 
<P>    "SHADDUP an' siddown, you're a prisoner and you're my
guest," snarled Enright. "<I>Our</I> guest," he corrected, "me and
the U.S. Government. So you'll accept our damn hospitality and
enjoy our lousy grub whether you like it or not. And you,
tavern-keeper, I could put this place off-limits to every
soldier in a hundred miles ... includin' any visitin' British.
You got that?"
<P>    As the hospitality issue was being settled, Cyrus strode in.
"Orders of the day posted, sir.  Ever'thin's all set fer
Lootenant Fieldin' here, har, har." 
<P>    "Well, then, shackle up the young fire-bug good and
tight. ... Till we can get rid of him once and for all." The
Colonel's digestion had apparently gone sour.
<P>
<P>    Threading narrow lanes, they reached Navy Bay where a ship
was preparing to sail. James' hopes soared -- till his fertile
imagination concocted a more sinister explanation. Suppose they
planned to dispose of him out in the lake. "Accidents" of that
sort did happen. The explanation, if the remains were ever
found, would be a plausible "death by drowning", put down as the
result of a boating mishap.
<P>     But surely the Colonel would see the holes in that scheme.
Assuming Paul had escaped capture, he'd have explained things to
their father on reaching the Canadian side. But the trouble was,
to completely rule out the death by accidental drowning plot,
you had to rely on the assumption that Colonel Enright had been
warned off by James' story about the boat and its additional
crew member. And that this shadowy individual would reach home
safely and tell the truth to the proper authorities. And be
believed in his own turn. It was much too complicated.
<P>    They were rowed out without ceremony. "Up anchor when you're
ready, Mr. Meacham," said the Colonel to the hang-dog officer in
charge of nautical matters. Sails were hoisted and a course set
for the open water of Lake Ontario. But to avoid the islands and
headlands at the entrance of the St. Lawrece, they steered west
and gave no immediate sign of changing tack for Kingston.
<P>     James monitored the tiniest nuances in the facial
expression of his captor. Colonel Enright took everything in,
but gave out only the most contradictory clues about his
intentions. Sensing he was under scrutiny, he glared back at
James, still not letting on if he was planning a dry land
repatriation or watery oblivion for his prisoner. 
<P>
<P>    The American shore receded in the haze of noonday. Was a
foreign country to be James' last sight of land? A few sail
showed against the horizon to the south-west. Trading vessels
running to Oswego or the Niagara Frontier. On the open lake, a
distinct swell and clouds towering higher as the day advanced.
They were now about a mile or so east of Main Duck Island. Too
far to swim for it with manacles on his wrists.
<P>    He recalled other days on this great land-locked sea,
learning the arts of boat-handling with his friends. They'd
landed once on Main Duck, anchored in a sheltered cove, camped
out and fished, collecting berries and birds' eggs. He'd
pretended he was Robinson Crusoe, castaway on a deserted island,
a scant 20 miles from home.
<P>    James stared north-east toward the maze of islands guarding
the outlet of the lake and wondered if he'd ever see the salty
reaches of the Atlantic. But that was far down the St. Lawrence
and past the Gulf. Not knowing if he'd survive even the coming
afternoon, he fought hysteria by dwelling on the far horizon,
his own private symbol for eternal life.
<P>    Somewhere out there in the west lay the Missouri territory
where Enright had apparently accepted a posting. The broader
context was coming into focus now -- that letter he'd read in
the blockhouse by candlelight. After this affair was over, his
captor would be heading for greener pastures. Actually, <I>golden</I>
pastures, with snowy mountains as a backdrop. But the heavenly
kingdom had nothing to do with James Fielding.
<P>    Voices at the forward rail roused him from sombre reverie. A
crew member relayed the news. "Sail off the sta'bud bow,
Colonel." 
<P>    "Do tell. Now, why don't you drop a hint to Mr. Meacham.
Maybe he can send some sailor in need of exercise up to the
masthead with a telescope?" To Cyrus, the Colonel added under
his breath, "The man's totally lacking in initiative.
Commodore's brother-in-law, wouldn't you know."
<P>    James took in everything. Mr. Meacham, for reasons unknown,
was on the Colonel's hate list. Should he throw himself on the
man's mercy, even though he might be entrusting his life to a
weakling?
<P>    A seaman climbed the ratlines and stood on the cross-trees
adjusting the instrument. After a pause, he snapped it shut and
returned to the deck. At length the Colonel received the
intelligence that a lone British warship was sailing from the
direction of Kingston. Her gun ports were open and marines were
lined up on deck.
<P>    "Thanks, sonny. I think we can handle 'er just fine." He
glanced meaningfully at James, then back at the crewman. "My
compliments to the Captain of this scow. And will you kindly
suggest that he send someone down to the magazine for a spot of
gunpowder. I should veddy much like to exercise that artillery
piece over yonder."
<P>    The Colonel was trying to put on a British accent, a most
peculiar thing. Perhaps it was in sarcastic imitation of some
imagined counterpart in the vessel that was now on a
fast-converging tack. James was thoroughly bewildered by the
man's inconsistent humour.
<P>    As the two ships closed the distance, the Colonel interfered
more and more in the practical matters of ship-handling.
<P>    "Tell the Captain to trim them sails neater. And steer
straight across her course. We'll go about at the last blessed
second. Let's see if we can throw a scare into them. Say, will
y'look at that damned Union Jack flying over U.S. territorial
waters."
<P>    James surged with resentment at the Colonel's unshakable
self-assurance. Like as not, they were equidistant from both
shores, though any treaty adjustments would probably favour the
Americans. But he knew that his bitterness was totally irrelevant. 
<P>    A fantastic premonition hit him. He'd be in the middle of a
major boundary incident. He could even visualize the headlines:
<P> BRITISH PATROL BOAT SINKS U.S. VESSEL.
<P> AMERICAN GOVERNMENT DEMANDS REDRESS.
<P>Buried on the back pages would be an obituary in fine print:
"James, son of Captain and Mrs. Fielding, vanished on Lake
Ontario during a boating trip." He wondered if anyone would make
the connection. 
<P>    But he'd never submit. He must try to signal his comrades.
Although his hands were manacled in front, he could still raise
arms above shoulder height. Someone on the British ship would be
watching through a spyglass and report any commotion. They were
now entering extreme firing range and he could see a flash of
red uniforms on deck. His own people were aboard her; he must
act to warn them.
<P>    Colonel Enright closely monitored the approaching warship.
It was less than a mile off the bow and steering across their
own track. While he was looking the other way, James dashed for
the ratlines. Despite the manacles, he managed to hoist himself
up on the rail and begin climbing. Part way up, he hooked a leg
into the netting and raised his arms, body gyrating wildly out
of balance. 
<P>    "Watch out behind you, Colonel," came a shout from the
wheel. Enright sprinted across the deck and grabbed a foot while
a seaman swarmed up to haul the prisoner down. 
<P>    "Lock him up till I give the order. Crazy kid'll fall
overboard," bellowed the Colonel and James was bundled forward
and thrust into the cable locker. 
<P>    He barely had time to find his footing when a hoarse bosun's
voice began croaking out orders.
<P>    "Lay 'er on the same course. Hard to starboard. ... A'right,
let 'er come up into the wind a bit more. ... Stand by to go
about. ... Wait for it, ye boobies. ... NOW! Man the braces!" A
pounding of feet on the planks, an interval of flapping canvas.
Then the sails re-filled and the deck tilted, pitching him into
the coils of mouldy cable. 
<P>    Enright's voice boomed above the confusion. "Hurry up. Get
that gun ready." 
<P>    The ship steadied herself and James found an uncaulked seam
in the hull just under the deck planking. He stood on the coils
and applied his eye. They were now sailing parallel with the
British ship. On her deck was a line of marines with muskets at
the ready. In the bow beside a cannon port, the upright figure
of an officer in cocked hat. A gun crew was running the weapon
out, ready to fire. The figure raised an arm holding something
aloft that glinted in the sun. A sabre. The arm dropped. An
orange flash burst from the gunport. A split-second later, the
distant cry of the officer: "FIRE!" and the bang of the British
ship's six-pounder.
<P>    A husky roar from the deck above was the American answer.
"What're you waiting for? Shoot, damn you, SHOOT!" The
shocking concussion overhead seemed to crush the walls of
James' prison inward. He started up, barking his forehead on the
planking, then sank to his knees, ears ringing in pain. Acrid
smoke infiltrated through the ventilation gratings. Choking in
ignorance while the smother cleared, he put his watering eye to
the crack. The British ship now appeared close enough for the
marines on deck to open fire.
<P>    An interval of creaking, with the odd sneeze from James as
the sulphurous fumes dissipated from the confines of the cable
locker.
<P>    "That's it, a tad closer, Mr. Meacham." Unexpectedly calm,
matter-of-fact tones from the Colonel.
<P>    "Seaman Plunkett, I'll have you show a little more care with
the Commodore's gig. Her paint's still fresh. Mind those ropes
don't bind." It was the harried voice of Mr. Meacham, seemingly
anxious to assert some vestige of authority.
<P>    Good God, they're abandoning ship. This was the sole thought
that entered James' head while his ears were still buzzing from
the report of the gun. Then the squealing of blocks and the
scrape of seamen's feet heralded the boat being swung out and
lowered over the side. Close to panic, he hammered on the inside
of the bolted hatchway. 
<P>    A splash as the boat hit the water. Then the entrance to his
prison flew wide open, letting in a welcome draught of fresh
air.
<P>    "You missed the fireworks, son," said the Colonel. "C'mon
out and join the party." 
<P>    Hardly a pistol shot away, the British ship lay hove-to,
serenely undamaged, marines and crew unmarked by American
hostility. At her rail stood a line of officers, and a familiar
one wearing the uniform of the Royal Artillery. A civilian
passenger was being helped into the ship's boat. This process
had the unlikely assistance of a huge sergeant-major of dragoons
who applied downward leverage with a boot. Eventually, the
passenger was detached from the netting where he clung,
reluctant to make the final leap. With somewhat better grace,
both the sergeant and the artillery officer followed and the
boat cast off.
<P>    "Time to be on your way, young fella," said the Colonel.
"Mustn't keep His Britannic Majesty waiting. Didn't I promise
you'd get what's coming to you?" The Colonel surveyed the
prisoner and his jaw fell. "Say, that ain't no get-up for a
diplomatic confabulation. Meacham, get these manacles off of
young Fielding. We don't want his Daddy to think we've been
administering cruel and unusual punishment. And you, son, wipe
those smears off your face before your father sees you." 
<P>    James tumbled into the bow of the American boat, awash in
confused sentiments of relief and perplexity at the surprising
benevolence of his captor. Colonel Enright followed and assumed
a position in the stern as the seamen obeyed the order to row
toward the British. Coming together, they exchanged lines and
withdrew oars with elaborate precision, swinging round
stern-to-stern and holding position by boathooks. 
<P>    At first the seamen confined themselves to stealing sly
glances at their opposite numbers. Satisfied that the officers
were preoccupied by the affairs of state taking place in the
stern, they began a surreptitious trade in small articles of
personal comfort such as liquor and tobacco. At the same time,
they cheerfully exchanged <I>sotto voce</I> insults about the quality
of the other side's seamanship. 
<P>    The tiller-men hunched down, keeping below the line of
verbal cross-fire they expected to break out any minute. The
officers were more conscious of the need to cast some mantle of
decorum over these irregular proceedings. Both Colonel Enright
and Captain Fielding had on full-dress uniform, and sat primly
upright on the stern seats of their respective cockleshells. The
lake had a definite swell and the two officers took turns
glaring severely at each other from atop the passing wave as the
boats bobbed alternately up and down. The elder Fielding was the
first to speak.
<P>    "So happy to see you, Colonel. When was the last time?"  He
proffered a bulging packet of folded paper from the bosom of his
tunic.
<P>    "Plattsburgh," growled Enright as he read the note, grimaced and
pocketed the ring it contained. An involuntary twitch briefly
agitated the Fielding moustaches. "... But today, Captain,
you'll not escape so easily. I want to propose a fairer trade
this time.  One British agent, who claims he got lost on the way
to Oswego, for a hogshead of the best wine the Royal Artillery
Officer's Mess can provide." 
<P>    "Never fear, Colonel, we can do better than that. We are
prepared to trade man for man. May I introduce Mr. Sullivan, who
is, I'm quite sure, a valued associate of yours." With this
introduction, Sullivan stood up in the bow of the British boat
and appealed to the Colonel.
<P>    "As a citizen of the Republic, sir, I ask you to demand
restitution for all me personal property as was confiscated by
the thievin' lackeys of his Satanic Majesty ..." 
<P>    The Colonel pulled a wry face at this surprising
development. He looked relieved when one of the British seamen
interrupted the oration by hauling Sullivan down into the
bilges.
<P>    "Captain, this is a mite unexpected. I dunno if we can go
ahead with the deal. If the U.S. Government has to accept that
mangy crittur in exchange for this young fire-eater here, we'll
sure as hell need some additional compensation." 
<P>    Captain Fielding leaned over to his seatmate and whispered,
"Looks like they've got us over a barrel, Sergeant Crocker."
Together they wrestled a cask out of the boat's stern locker and
placed it on the seat. "I'm afraid it's not quite as big as a
hogshead, Colonel. But it <I>is</I> an excellent Madeira. It's all
His Majesty's Government is able to offer at this time."
<P>    "In that case, I'm bound to accept. Prepare to exchange
prisoners."
<P>    The boats' gunwales were pulled closer together. James and
Sullivan slithered across in opposite directions. Safely in the
American boat, Sullivan looked puzzled about something, finally
fixing his eye on Enright.
<P>    "That was no even trade, Colonel. A pipkin of a lad for a
hogshead of a ... I mean to say, a boy for a man ..."
<P>    The Colonel paused, looked him up and down, then drawled,
"Yer damn right. I should've held out for the hogshead and left
the hog's <I>ass</I> behind."  As the boats pulled back to their
respective ships, Enright's voice came faintly downwind. "For
chrissake, Maidstone, can't you <I>ever</I> do a job right?" 
<P>    Her boat hoisted aboard, the British ship turned and made
for Kingston. With a glance at the departing American, Captain
Fielding fixed his son with an old gunlayer's eye. James set his
teeth and braced for the detonation.
<P>    "My boy, your brother has brought back two saddle bags of
rather valuable information. I shall expect a full report by the
time we reach harbour. Go down to the ship's wardroom. The
steward will provide writing materials. I'm interested in any
revealing details of your conversation with the Colonel. As soon
as your mother has an opportunity to see you are safe, we shall
leave for Montreal. It's high time you entered the army. By the
way, the map you discovered was not of Sackets Harbor. It was a
copy of my own design for Fort Henry, unfortunately, not
implemented. Extremely odd that Enright should have it. By the
way, did I ever tell you I'd met the Colonel before? Fellow
Mason. Got along famously, we did." 
<P>    That map he'd picked up in the fort -- somehow, it'd been
stolen by Enright or his agents. What sort of man was he? One
moment keeping a mysterious trust with an enemy officer and
lodge brother; the next, purloining military secrets that might
have sealed the fate of thousands. James sat down at the
wardroom table and stared at a sheet of blank paper.
<P>    How soon the scorched fingers heal, grasp again the blazing
torch. He pictured the Colonel galloping westward on some
clandestine mission that only he, James Fielding, could fully
comprehend. The game was <I>not</I> up. If only he had the resources,
the independence, the authority to pursue the matter further,
what secrets might he discover? As the first one to start the
fox from his lair, he now felt a responsibility, even a <I>right</I>,
to set off in hot pursuit, a fresh mount under him.
<P>    Outside the wardroom window, the Colonel's ship was already
dwindling to a speck on the horizon. James' own sense of
proportion was also altering. No longer was he a child among
giants. He was almost a man among men. But a price had to be
paid.  He'd have to abandon the childish sport of fox and hounds
forever. Together with all the hastily packed knapsacks, the
rusty muskets, the leaky canoes of youth. To overtake the
Colonel now, he'd need the authority of a general, the strength
of a regiment, the equipment and funds a government alone could
supply. Only the tools of adulthood could do the job. But only
the freedom of youth would want to do it.
<P>    He leaned forward with a sigh and began penning what was to
be his first official report.

<div class=Section1>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>At the time this article was
written David Pond was a Research Officer in the Legislative Research Service
of the Ontario Legislative Library. This is a revised version of a paper which
was prepared for the Ontario Delegation to the 16<sup>th</sup> Canadian
Regional Seminar of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association held in
Whitehorse in November 1991. </span></p>

<p><i><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A newfound enthusiasm for direct
democracy, in the form of referenda and plebiscites, is spreading across
Canada. In June 1991 the Quebec National Assembly passed a bill which empowers
the Quebec government to hold a referendum on the constitutional future of the
province in 1992. In the October 1991 elections held in Saskatchewan and
British Columbia, referendum and plebiscite questions were on the ballot. (In
Saskatchewan the voters agreed that the provincial government should be
required to introduce balanced budget legislation, and that the public should
have the right to approve through a referendum any proposed constitutional
amendments; they also voted no to a question asking them whether the government
should pay for abortions. In B.C., the voters voted yes to questions asking
them whether they should have the right to recall their MLAs, and to propose
referendum questions). This paper explains how referenda and plebiscites work,
and assesses their impact in two of those democracies which have experimented
with them.</span></i><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A referendum is a vote of all
eligible voters in a jurisdiction on a proposed policy or law. The wording will
be in the form of a question, which the voters will be required to answer with
a yes or a no. Referenda can be binding on the government which conducts them,
or merely advisory.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Historically, the terms plebiscite
and referendum have been used interchangeably. The former is the older term,
dating back to 4th century B.C. Rome. The plebiscite has tended to be the term
used to describe references to the people of a specific question entailing the
approval of a leader, regime, or a change in national boundaries. Plebiscites
have been employed in Europe to sanction the unification of disparate
city-states (into modern Italy), the creation of new nations (Norway's
separation from Sweden in 1905), and the resolution of boundary disputes
(Schleswig's with France and Germany in the 1920s). Napoleon used plebiscites
to demonstrate popular support for annexations by France of other countries,
and revisions of the French constitution.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>In recent decades the term
referendum has replaced plebiscite in common usage. For example, Denmark, Ireland,
France, Norway and the United Kingdom held referenda, not plebiscites, on the
question of membership in the European Economic Community in the early 1970s.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Saskatchewan's recent Referendum
and Plebiscite Act revives the use of the term plebiscite, to describe a
referendum held under its provisions whose result is not binding on the
government. Under the Saskatchewan Act, a plebiscite must be held once a
petition calling for one on a particular question is signed by at least 15% of
the electorate. This kind of referendum or plebiscite is more commonly known as
the initiative. The initiative is most used today in the United States and
Switzerland. It is a device which enables the citizenry to vote on a measure
before it becomes law. It differs from the referendum in that the decision to
hold a vote originates with the electorate, not the government. The initiative
procedure is attractive to enthusiasts of direct democracy because it empowers
the voters to bypass a government reluctant to introduce a policy which enjoys
popular support.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The initiative enables citizens to
compel the government to hold a referendum on a measure supported by a
specified percentage of the voters who have signed a petition indicating their
support. Once the petition attracts the requisite number of signatures, a
national vote is automatically triggered. When a majority votes yes in the
vote, then the measure in question becomes law whether the government agrees
with it or not, or (as in the case of the Saskatchewan legislation) the
government is compelled to take whatever steps are necessary to implement the
result of the referendum, such as introducing a bill into the legislature.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The United States</span></b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The referendum and the initiative
have a long history in the United States, reflecting the country's populist
traditions and distrust of government. The referendum was introduced in the
Massachusetts Bay Colony as early as 1640 and the initiative in 1715. Today, 25
states and the District of Columbia use the referendum; 23 states and the District
use the initiative. Twelve states allow municipalities to use the initiative.
Congress has never adopted either the referendum or the initiative, though it
has debated the possibility on a number of occasions. In the November 1988
elections in the U.S., there were more than 200 referendum questions and
initiatives on the ballot in 41 states. In California alone there were 29
initiatives.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Perhaps the most famous initiative
was Proposition 13 in California whose passage in 1978 slashed property taxes
by half and compelled painful cuts in public services. Examples of initiative
questions and referendum voted in recent US elections include:</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in Massachusetts, whether to shut down two nuclear power plants with
poor safety records, and whether to cut state taxes;</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in Michigan and Arkansas, whether to continue public funding of
abortions;</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in California, whether to require an HIV test for anyone charged with
assault or sex crimes; and</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in Colorado, whether all proposed tax increases should be put to a
public vote.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>One of the most striking
developments in the use of the initiative in recent years is the number of
petitions aimed at modifying the operation of the state legislatures. The
following are examples of initiative questions of this nature circulated among
the voters in the last three elections.</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in Alaska and Oregon, whether to reduce the salaries of state
legislators;</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in California and Kansas, whether to reapportion the state legislature;
and</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>in Colorado, California and Oklahoma, whether to set limits on how many
terms a state legislator can serve.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Until 1990 few of these initiatives
passed. In 1990, however, the voters of Colorado and Oklahoma overwhelmingly
approved an initiative proposal to limit the term of state legislators to eight
years. In California the voters approved Proposition 140, which set strict
limits on the number of years any statewide office-holder could serve, from
governor to the superintendent of education. Under this Proposition, state
senators, who serve a four-year term, are limited to two terms; and members of
the state assembly, who serve a two-year term, are limited to a maximum of
three. In addition, Proposition 140 cut by a third all legislators' salaries
and their office budgets, and eliminated legislators' pensions. Students of
Californian politics suggest that Proposition 140 has eliminated full-time
professional politicians from state politics. Critics argue that a legislature
composed of part-time, inexperienced legislators will be more vulnerable to
lobbyists.1</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Another feature of contemporary
&quot;initiatie politics&quot; which is worth pointing out is the significant
number of initiatives introduced by politicians themselves. For example in
California 15% of all initiatives circulated for signatures since 1970 have
been authored by state politicians. Moreover, they have been the proponents of
more than one-third of the initiatives which actually qualified for the
ballot.2</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A number of reasons have been
offered for why politicians might want to start initiatives:</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>he or she can draft the measure to read exactly as desired; a bill, in
contrast, will often have to be amended to attract the support of other
legislators;</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>the initiative campaign, regardless of whether it is successful, can be
used by a politician to raise his or her profile in the community and the
media; and</span></p>

<p style='margin-right:.5in;margin-left:.5in'><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Arial'>members of a minority party in the legislature can use the initiative
process to introduce measures the majority party is blocking in the
legislature.3</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>There is a long-running debate among
students of initiatives over whether the process favours left- or right-wing
causes. One study found that between 1977 and 1986, 43 out of 96 initiatives
qualifying for the ballot across the country which were introduced by liberal,
environmentalist or left-leaning groups passed, for a success rate of 43%,
while 41 out of 91 initiatives introduced by right-wing groups passed, for a
success rate of 45%.4 This suggests that the initiative is a politically
neutral instrument which activists on both the left and the right can wield
with roughly equal chances of success. However, critics point to the high costs
of circulating a petition for signatures and the subsequent campaign, and argue
that well-heeled business lobbying groups can afford to spend the money
necessary to defeat measures proposed by reform and progressive groups.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>A study of initiatives which
qualified for the ballot in California shows that between 1980 and 1987, the
side spending the most money 16 times won. Total spending by both sides in the
29 campaigns amounted to $130 million.5 On the other hand, in recent years
there have been a number of high-profile campaigns in which the big spenders
lost. For example, in 1986 in California Proposition 65, the Clean Water-Get
Tough on Toxics Initiative, passed though its opponents outspent its supporters
by a margin of more than three-to-one. In 1988, Proposition 99, a 25-cent tax
increase on cigarettes passed despite a massive spending campaign against it by
business. It remains true, however, that critics of the initiative will always
be able to cite campaigns in which it appears that money made the difference. A
recent prominent example occurred in November 1990 when a recycling initiative
in Oregon was defeated in a campaign which saw the oil and chemical industry
outspend environmentalists by a margin of eight-to-one, which included a $2.5
million television advertising campaign. The &quot;yes&quot; campaign was ahead
in the polls before its opponents' negative television adds were aired.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Switzerland</span></b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Direct democracy also has deep
historical roots in Switzerland. As early as the 13th century some Swiss
cantons (the equivalent of provinces in Canada) regularly made decisions by
popular assent in citizen assemblies. As the population grew and such assemblies
became impractical (today they survive only in the more thinly populated
mountain cantons), the referendum was adopted as a means of continuing this
tradition of direct democracy.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>All amendments to the Swiss
constitution which are approved by the federal parliament must be submitted to
a popular referendum. As well, 100,000 citizens (just under 3% of the
electorate) can trigger a referendum on a proposed amendment by signing a
petition containing its text within 18 months of its publication. This is known
as a constitutional initiative. The Swiss National Assembly cannot change the
text proposed in a constitutional initiative, but it can present a
counter-proposal, which sometimes results in the withdrawal of the initiative
by its sponsors. All constitutional amendments proposed in a referendum
(including a counter-proposal) must win the support of a majority of those
voting nationally, and a majority of the cantons. This latter requirement makes
it impossible for the large urban cantons to impose an amendment on the smaller
rural ones.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>An ordinary law passed by the
federal parliament is not subject to a referendum, unless this is demanded by
50,000 citizens (in the form of a petition) or eight cantonal governments
within 90 days of its publication. If a referendum is held, only a simple
majority of those voting is necessary for the law to carry. Certain categories
of legislation, such as the budget, are exempt from the referendum process.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The use of referenda and
initiatives by the cantons varies. In some cantons, including the populous ones
of Zurich, Berne and Argau, a referendum is obligatory for all laws passed by
the cantonal parliament, excluding certain kinds of financial legislation. (The
legislative output of the cantonal legislatures is considerably smaller than
that of Canadian provincial legislatures). In other cantons, a referendum can
be triggered by a petition: the number of signatures required varies
considerably from canton to canton. In addition, all cantons employ the
legislative initiative, whereby the signatures of specified numbers of citizens
on a petition can trigger a vote on a law passed by the cantonal parliament.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>The only comprehensive statistical
study in English on direct democracy in Switzerland was published in 1979, and
it focused exclusively on federal politics. It found that between 1848 and
1978, 212 referenda on constitutional questions were held. In 199, the majority
of the population and a majority of the cantons voted the same way (107 yes,
and 92 no). In each of the five cases in which an over-all majority voted yes,
but the cantons voted no and prevented the proposal from becoming law, the
proposal would have given new powers to the federal government. In 18 cases the
federal parliament put forward a counter-proposal: in seven out of the 18 the
original initiative was then withdrawn.6</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Another study, also published in
1979, found that between 1945 and 1977, 55% of all constitutional initiatives
were started by political parties, mostly by the smaller ones which had little
hope of forming the government.7 As in the U.S., therefore, direct democracy
enables politicians excluded from power to circumvent the control exercised
over the legislative agenda by the dominant political forces.</span></p>

<p><b><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Conclusion</span></b><span
style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'></span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>It is difficult to make generalizations
about how political institutions developed in another society would work in
one's own. However, the experience of the U.S. and Switzerland with the
referendum and initiative do suggest that while these devices may well enable
popular sentiment to be brought directly to bear on the political process, they
will be utilized by those already involved in political activity — interest
groups and the politicians themselves.</span></p>

<p><span style='mso-bidi-font-family:Arial'>Critics of direct democracy suggest
that in a parliamentary democracy the ready use of the referendum or initiative
would undermine the legitimacy of representative government and downgrade that
status of the individual Member. Whether or not this is likely can only be a
matter of speculation. It is important to point out that under our system of
government public policies can only be transformed into legislation by means of
bills approved by the legislature and the government remains responsible for
the administration of legislation. Under the British Columbia and Saskatchewan
statutes providing for referenda, a referendum result in favour of a particular
policy simply requires the government to do whatever it deems &quot;necessary
or advisable&quot; to abide by the referendum result, such as changing existing
policies, or introducing new legislation into the legislature. Thus, the final
arbiters of public policy remain the elected legislators.</span></p>

<BR><B><P>Day 0, Teslin, Yukon R. canoe trip.</B>
<BR> * Back from Dawson.
<BR> * Briefing by outfitter.
<BR> * Sea-to-Sky Expeditions.
<BR> * We get paddles, PFDs and wet bags.

<I>D210-539 08-07-17</I> - <B>Back of our hotel, Whitehorse.</B><xxx>

<BR> <B>July 17, Thursday, day 0.</B>  We drive back to Whitehorse from Dawson and
unload the rental car. Merle and I have a conference with Sea-to-Sky
outfitters this evening, to meet the other trippers and to pick up canoe
gear. Miriam and Adonis prepare for their own jaunt on the Chilkoot Pass
hike. We'll see them again later to compare notes after we've all finished
both trips.
<BR><B><P>Day 1, Start of canoe trip.</B>
<BR> * Wet weather, used Olympus D40 camera.
<BR> * Put-in, Johnson's Crossing, Teslin R.
<BR> * On the Trans Canada highway.
<BR> * Trucked to launch site by outfitter.
<BR> * Eight campers, two guides.
<BR> * A modest day's paddle, about 30km?

<I>D212-069 08-07-18</I> - <B>Johnson's crossing, Teslin R.</B><xxx>

<BR><B>July 18, Friday, day 1.</B>  We're picked up at our hotel by the outfitter and
taken with the other canoe trippers to our put-in point on the Teslin River.
This is where the Alaska Highway crosses via the high bridge.

<I>D212-071 08-07-18</I> - <B>Merle and Derek play catch-up.</B><xxx>

<BR>Here the river is wide and opens out into a series of narrow lakes. The
current at the start is fairly sedate. With the weather threatening rain, we
have a good day's paddle of about 30km ahead of us. After only a few
kilometers I begin to remember why I prefer the kayak to the canoe for
extended trips. No back rest in the canoe, and with the knees pushed up in
front, only my abdominal muscles keep me upright. Nevertheless, these canoes
are fast and carry an incredible amount of gear in the two middle
compartments.

<I>D212-072 08-07-18</I> - <B>Rafting together for instructions.</B><xxx>

<BR>The group links canoes together for instructions in general safety procedure
and paddling techniques. Our equipment has been tied down in a kind of daisy
chain, instead of being fastened tightly to the thwarts. This is to keep
everything attached to the canoe in the event of a capsize, but to allow a
swamped boat to be more easily righted and emptied without the extra weight
of the equipment to contend with.

fellow tripper in the blue jacket had the foresight to bring his own chair.

<BR>Keep a watch for trees dipping down into the water. To brush against them
with the current moving this fast might be dangerous. The canoe could become
trapped, turn sideways, have the downstream side pushed up on the branches
and then roll the upstream side under the water.

<I>D211-009 08-07-21</I> - <B>You deserve another rafting break.</B><xxx>

<BR>In the afternoon more rafting to help us relax. We miss a few possible
campsites by overshooting. Terrific current. Difficult to land without risk
of capsizing. We receive instructions from Len and Kelly on a new canoe
stroke. I call it the "cut". You paddle along close to the shore, whizzing
past at 10 to 15km an hour. At a command from the stern, the bow person
thrusts the paddle in, but diagonally forward, holding it against the
gunwale. The opposite hand holds the head of the paddle on the outside of the
chin to avoid a broken jaw if it strikes something in the water at that
speed. Meanwhile the stern-person has angled their paddle diagonally
backward. The combined effect of the manoeuvre is to quickly pivot the canoe
almost 180 degrees so that you are now facing upstream and headed diagonally
shoreward. Vigorous forward paddling against the current ferries the canoe
more gently sideways to a landing on shore.

about travel horror shows, bus breakdowns, lost luggage. London, England

canoes are pulled out and tied down. Our tents go up in record time. Golly,
we're getting efficient at this.

<BR>In the afternoon I try "drafting" behind Kelly, the leader in our
formation. Following very closely, no more than ten feet behind another canoe
does seem to make progress slightly easier. The downside is that you use up a
lot of nervous energy attempting to track the sometimes erratic movements of
the leader. I remember trying this during a ten mile footrace in Welland. I
accidently stepped on the heel of my windbreak's running shoe, and had to
sprint from there on to avoid his wrath.

<BR>There are strange things done in the Land of the Midnight Sun. So, when does

for Merle and I. Four of our number are not going on to Dawson. I sit on the
butt of a poplar tree on the riverbank and meditate on the human condition.
The river sluices past. Who can step into the same river twice? (Heracleitos)
Since we've been camping at this spot, yesterday's water has moved 200 or
more kilometers closer to the sea. But the river is still not empty and the
sea is not filled. What gives?

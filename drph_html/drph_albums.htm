<BR>{notes}:
<BR> 11-04-22: Pics in this series reflect the original album order. Intended to
document the old albums and provide a basis for quick computer reference.
Individual pictures could be clipped out, improved, and version-named. Some
would have to be rescanned to provide adqequate resolution.
<BR> Not all album pages have been cropped to remove extraneous background. The
best pics in this series should probably be compiled into separate PTFs by
year, decade, person or theme. Most done 11-04-30.
<BR> A few more albums and collections of mantel photos in commercial folders
should be scanned.

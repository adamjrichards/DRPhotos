<P>Derek Richards was born in Montreal in 1937 and very early began
to show a sense of the pictorial. He still has visual
impressions of that city from the age of two. When his father enlisted in
the RCAF, the family moved
to the picturesque Eastern Townships where Derek was given a
Brownie camera and picked up a childhood interest in landscape
and nature photography. His favourite picture books at the time
were illustrated by engravings of scenic subjects. Moving to New
Brunswick and Europe with a father in the armed forces, he
continued an interest in photography, experimenting with
darkroom print-making, colour slides, and had a brief fling at
free-lance photography.
<P>
<P>Married, with 4 children, and after a period in Toronto working
for the Ministry of the Environment, Derek eventually settled in
St. Catharines, in 1972, to work in computers at the Lincoln
County Board of Education.
<P>
<P>At that time his photographic interests were chiefly absorbed by
making 35mm slide shows. Print-making remained a fond hope, but
despite the acquisition of darkroom facilities, proved to be too
unproductive for a photographer with a scarcity of time and
resources.
<P>
<P>However, Derek's experience in computers and small-scale
computer publishing fostered an interest in digital illustration
and printing.
That youthful ambition to do chemical print-making has now come
full circle with a new technology that provides all the
facilities and techniques of the early photo darkroom, but in a
context that increases productivity and brings the photo artist
ever closer to achieving the interpretive freedom of
water-colourists and other graphic artists.
<P>
<P>Derek's first show: "Hello, World!", at the Roselawn in Port Colborne, was
intended to be a celebration of the visual world and a tribute to the
emergence of these new opportunities in digital print-making for all visual
artists.

Kilimanjaro Ascent.
September 2001
<P><B>01-09-10: Monday. Departure for Africa.</B>
 We depart Woodside Drive at 12 noon. Panic this morning re VISA card. Can't
get online to check status of suspicious-looking balances. Oh well,
bankruptcy, here we come. Adam drives us to Audra's place where we wait for
Darlene, who is delayed due to road construction in Welland. On to Pearson
airport, Toronto. After takeoff: Brigit Jones plus Shrek on the video
monitors while we skim along at 1000 Km/hr, 10,000m altitude. Outside
temperature is -40 to -50 degrees Celsius. Sounds chilly, wonder what it's
going to be like at 6000m on top of Mount Kilimanjaro.

Schipol Airport, Amsterdam: large, interesting stores. Not quite exotic as
yet. On the next hop, the merely "different" will merge into the "exotic".
<P><B>09-11: Tuesday. In the air.</B>
 5:31pm local time. Just zipped over Khartoum while finishing an Eric Ambler
spy novel. Well-crafted plot, terror, intrigue, nothing  unusual. Land at
Kilimanjaro airport, near Arusha, Tanzania, after dusk. Much like Hamilton
airport, on a human scale. We change a little money (CDN$) to Tanzanian
Shillings (TZS). Somebody comes to get us in a Land Rover for the drive to
our hotel in Moshe.
<P><B>09-11: Arrival, Arusha, Tanzania.</B>
 Arrive late at the Hotel Buffalo in Moshe, to find the TV screens ablaze with
news of the New York bombing. This was probably happening while we were in
the air over Libya, Ghadaffi country. We sit down with our tour organizer,
Pius Kimati, to discuss arrangements and to fork over cash. Hard to
concentrate with the disaster news turned up loud, and repeated over and over
again. For some reason, find myself with only US$800 in cash. Not enough to
pay our share of the immediate expenses, $2200. Was assuming that I was going
to use travellers' cheques. Up against a cash economy here. We come to an
arrangement where I'll pay the Kilimanjaro Park fees in travellers' cheques,
at the park gate. Conveniently enough, this will be about the same as the
amount I owe, approx. $1400.
<P><B>09-12: Day 0, Wednesday - Rest and Recce.</B>
 A restless night. The mosquito netting over our bed seems dusty, suffocating.
We fling it aside and trust to anti-malaria medication, our second line of
defence. Wake up feeling woozy. Muezzin call at dawn, a second call, more
distant, sounds a lot like Hebrew to my ear. Not bloody likely. The Jewish
community here numbers approximately 2, all of them Canadian tourists,
keeping a low profile.

For breakfast, more news of the World Trade Centre attack. Surrounded in the
dining room by young American tourists in a state of shock while they watch
the TV reports and make plans to head for home.
 Rest day today: Time out to get over jet-lag, mull over the Trade Centre
disaster, and cash travellers' cheques. We visit Kilimanjaro park HQ at
Marengo with our guides, Amani and Oswald. 1970m. altitude. High forest,
eucalyptus, banana trees and cultivated fields located just outside the park
boundary. We stroll across a lush valley to a nearby village to meet some of
the locals who our guide knows. 

They have a farm and show us a few animals. The family looks desperately
poor. We try to offer them a little money for the privilege of staring at
their poverty. A young man, cadgier than the rest tries to appropriate a TZS
5000 (US$5.00) note for himself. Our guide, Amani, notices this and snatches
it away to hand over to the old man who is the nominal head of the family.
It's a dilemma: if you offer any money, it's an insult because no reasonable
amount is ever enough. If you offer nothing, you reinforce the stereotype of
privileged and selfish foreigners.

Down in a lush valley a river runs between banana trees and huge rocks.
someone is doing the laundry down there. For some reason it reminds me of a
literary scene I vaguely remember set in the South Pacific. Children play
hide-and-seek behind the trees.

On the way back we pass through village lanes. A boy is playing with a hoop
made of an old bicycle wheel. Haven't seen that game played since I was the
same age.

Temperature: low 20s, back in Moshe, lower altitude, mid 30s.

Today we make calculations about how much we'll have to pay for our share of
the staff on this climb. 8 porters for 6 days at 10k shillings per day is TZS
480k. The chief guide at 15k/day, 90k. Ditto, the cook, 90k. Assistant guide,
70k. Total: TZS 730,000. Our share for two people out of four is TZS 365,000.
The entire expedition comprises 4 climbers, 8 porters, 2 guides and 1 cook --
a troop of 15 people in all
<P><B>09-13: Day 1, Thursday - To Machame camp, Mt. Kilimanjaro.</B>

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-02.jpeg">
<I>1211-02 01-09-13</I> - <B>Hotel Buffalo, our base while in Moshe.</B>

Day 1, Thurday, departure, the first day on the trail. We reorganize our
packs, leaving a few things in the hotel Buffalo storeroom. Stuff that'll
only be used on our safari later on.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1216/1216-08.jpeg">

<I>1211-03 </I> - <B>Loading up the climbing luggage.</B>

We stand around the hotel compound waiting for the Land Rover to be loaded.
Amani, our chief guide, doesn't think I'm going to be able to manage the
large blue backpack. So I repack my personal gear into a smaller rucksack.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-05.jpeg">
<I>1211-05 </I> - <B>Kilimanjaro Park entrance, weigh-in.</B>

Riding in the Land Rover, we bump our way up to the Machame park entrance at
1700m altitude, a modest 5000ft. All four of us climbers, Merle, Audra,
Darlene and Derek are now packed, zipped up and ready to go, but we have
delays in starting. Derek has to stand in line while endless forms are filled
out and travellers' cheques signed. Then, more problems sorting out the
porters, weighing and assigning loads. Audra has brought a duffle bag that is
big enough to hold the equipment of the entire Fort Erie lacrosse team. A
full load for one porter -- a very strong porter. Much standing around
wondering exactly what the hell is going on.

Amani temporarily disappears. A suspicious park ranger carrying a rifle wants
to know who our guide is. No one is supposed to trek up the mountain
unsupervised.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-06.jpeg">
<I>1211-06 </I> - <B>Amani, our chief guide.</B>

Here, Amani our chief guide seems to be saying: So long, it's been good to
know you. Departure is at 11:30am. We enter the rainforest at last. He leads
the way, probably wondering what kind of a crew this will turn out to be.

<I>1211-08 </I> - <B>Rest stop.</B>

Enormous trees, ferns, and flowers keep us busy asking questions of our
guides. Amani and Oswald seem to know the Latin names of everything. The
trail is smooth and easy going, but steadily upward.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-11.jpeg">
<I>1211-11 </I> - <B>Lunch stop.</B>

We have a picnic lunch in deep shade. A light shower worries us for about 30
seconds. Mutters of thunder in the west. Above the tree-tops: sunny, wisps of
cloud.

<I>1211-12 </I> - <B>A life of luxury for Audra?</B>

Audra is trying out her "bionic woman" knee protectors. They're supposed to
guard against sideways twisting.

<I>1211-14 </I> - <B>We emerge from the rain-forest.</B>

At the end of 9.5mi of trail, we emerge from heavy forest into a region of
scrub and smaller trees. Drier, cooler too, less humid. Interesting as the
forest is, it feels good to get out into the open where you can see the
overall context.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-16.jpeg">
<I>1211-16 </I> - <B>Machame camp, crowded with Canadians.</B>

Machame Camp is located at 3000m, about 9000ft. When we get there, the place
is already crawling with Canadians. Putting up our tent, we overhear
next-door conversations between the young guns of the Calgary oil patch, who,
oddly enough, are discussing amatory conquests, rather than drilling rights.
Merle gets busy updating her diary.

The Milky Way is fiercely bright tonight.
<P><B>09-14: Day 2, Friday - Shira Plateau</B>

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-17.jpeg">
<I>1211-17 </I> - <B>Above the forest at last.</B>

Day 2, Friday, to the Shira Plateau. Many pees last night. Our plastic
bottles turn out to be invaluable, but you have to be really careful to aim
accurately in the dark and to guard against overflow. Temperature, about zero
degrees, celsius. The lowlands are covered in overcast at dawn. Clear, the
sun is up, but behind the flank of the mountain. I sneak out at 6am to empty
the bottles. 

We're the first to pack our kit. Much to-ing and fro-ing. Everybody has to
walk through everybody else's campsite to get anywhere. Mind you don't step
in that damp patch, young gun.

We start walking today at 9:15am. Toiling up a very long, steep ridge. All
the surrounding country is under cloud, but way back down there, you can
still catch a glimpse of Machame camp in the bush to the centre right.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1211/1211-22.jpeg">
<I>1211-22 </I> - <B>Senecio Kilimanjari, 10,000 ft.</B>

We encounter the statuesque whatsis plant, almost a trademark of Mt.
Kilimanjaro. Senecio Kilimanjari, Amani calls it. Haven't heard this much
Latin since high school. No sign as yet of the Giant Lobelia we're supposed
to be looking for. Uncle Fraser has asked for a full botanical report.

<I>1211-24 </I> - <B>Above the forest but below the clouds.</B>

Those clouds still seem pretty far above us. Our camp tonight, on the Shira
Plateau, is somewhere over the horizon.

<I>1212-01 01-09</I> - <B>Merle, Darlene, to the Shira Plateau.</B>

Some years back, this area was the scene of a large fire that burnt across the
side of the mountain up to the edge of the plateau above.

visibility.

Everywhere in this vicinity, there's the scent of some wild herb. We never
did find out what it was, something like the herbs of Provence.

<I>1212-08a </I> - <B>Lunch on the way to Shira camp.</B>

We didn't realize at first how much the porters were lugging along to keep us
comfortable. This turned out to an iron, not an aluminum, folding camp table
and stools -- a luxury we enjoyed till our last night. The ladies are trying
to look very pukka, formal and correct,

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1212/1212-10.jpeg">

<I>1212-16 </I> - <B>Audra approaching Shira campsite.</B>

 Climbing up over the edge of the plateau from our first campsite, the trail
begins dropping slightly. The burnt area noted during this morning's ascent
doesn't extend to the plateau, where there's much less vegetation and colder
temperatures.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1212/1212-17.jpeg">
<I>1212-17 </I> - <B>Shira camp.</B>

 Its been about five miles up a steep ridge to the Shira Plateau and Shira
Campsite. Now we can see for vast distances, round and about the tenting
area, across the broad shoulders of the mountain. The main bulk of the
Kibo crater is close now, and huge. Maybe a little intimidating.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1212/1212-18.jpeg">

far horizon or from the surounding forest.

<I>1212-20 </I> - <B>Dusk, Shira camp.</B>

Audra is slightly ill tonight. Altitude perhaps. We're all taking Diamox,
which is normally a glaucoma medicine. Audra wonders if perhaps the pills are
making her ill. The medicine increases the respiration rate as well as being
a kind of diuretic to prevent the build-up of cerebral edema caused by lower
atmospheric pressure. In the mornings I look forward to the ritual of pulling
out my medicine kit and popping down aspirin, anti-malaria and Diamox pills.
Then washing them all down with several cups of my recent favourite:
Afri-cafe instant coffee, made in Tanzania.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1212/1212-23.jpeg">
<I>1212-23 </I> - <B>Morning coffee, Shira camp.</B>

A rest day today. The dawn dawns clear and cold. Coffee and hot
water brought to the door our our tent help us wake up. Ice on the roof.
The shadow of Kilimanjaro's main massif creeps down the spires of Shira
Cathedral very slowly.

<I>1212-25 </I> - <B>Shira Cathedral, Needle, Shira camp.</B>

Then, 15minutes later, bang! The sun is up like thunder and the whole
campsite bathed in brilliant light. The temperature immediately begins to
rise from zero degrees to more temperate levels. The plains below are covered
in haze and low cloud, but we don't care, we're far above the petty concerns
of normal earthlings. Rapture of the heights I think they call it.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1213/1213-03p.jpeg">
<I>1213-03p </I> - <B>High altitude savannah.</B>

A late start, but we straggle across the plateau, meeting a group of
Tilley-attired Ottawa civil servants on the way back from a look at the
Cathedral. They have that dangerous, not-quite-over-the-hill-50-ish look, and
are on a grand tour to climb several other peaks in the area: Mts. Meru,
Ruwenzori, Mawenzi and others. But the Cathedral is socked-in with cloud so
they've turned back.

We carry on despite the cloud warnings and toil up a series of ridges to
eventually reach Shira Cathedral summit. Audra and Merle are ecstatic. Amani
phlegmatic. The rest (Derek and Darlene) are exhausted. Fantastic views of
clouds swirling round lava cliffs. I drink too much water, too fast, choke.
I'm carrying an extra litre, one more kilo added to the load. We share a lunch
of granola bars at the summit cairn. We're at about 4000m altitude, 12000ft.
But still there's plenty of scrub vegetation.

 We're now heading back to Shira camp. On the way we cross a plain where lava
"bombs" from some ancient eruption have fallen and lain unmoved for millenia.
We skirt the head of a high altitude access road that is sometimes used for
emergency evacuations.

 Shira camp #2, which we didn't visit, is somewhere up on the plateau to the
left.
 Nearing Shira Camp, a benevolent porter insists on carrying "Babu's" pack.
What an incredible  difference 10 lbs makes. I feel 10 years younger. I think
I actually enjoy being called "Babu". Sort of like "Gramps" or "Zaydy" in
Swahili. They're calling Merle "Bibi", the equivalent of "Bubby" I imagine.

about 4000m (12,500ft) high. Some "rest" day. And the cook is peeved with us;
we were supposed to be back for lunch. Hope he forgives us by supper time. I
flop down in the tent for a rest, then spy a picture of Kilimanjaro plus
Merle out the tent door. Well, maybe not quite exhausted just yet.

To Arrow camp. Kefuffle this morning about the use of
latrines. Amani catches me wandering off to take pictures, and suspecting
another, darker purpose, warns me that the camp custodians have arrived.
These park rangers have nabbed another climber, who is guilty of wandering
off into the bushes with his roll of white paper.

 The miscreant has to submit
to a severe dressing down and is sentenced to go round the campsite with a
plastic bag, picking up "debris". There is justice in this. Even organic
debris doesn't biodegrade quickly up here. Without constant vigilance, the
area would soon look like the Everest base camps.

We're now close to the Arrow Glacier summit base camp, located right up
against the side of the mountain. What I can see of the trail higher up looks
scary, with hanging glaciers on either side. My pedometer was reading 8mi. at
today's start, 12 at the end. Surely we've covered more ground than that.
Can't seem reset it to zero. To check validity of my figures, have to do
exhausting mental arithmetic at high altitude. Can't face it. Merle still a

The thin air that was merely piquant yesterday offers a serious challenge to
breathing today. This panorama is a montage of three pictures. The look of
upswept wings is determined by the image geometry and the upward angle of the
camera.

 All Kili images were scanned from 35mm 4x6 prints, taken by a compact
pocket "clamshell" camera. This was the only one I could keep at night in my
sleeping bag to prevent the batteries from freezing.

<I>1214-14 </I> - <B>Arrow Glacier, summit base camp, dusk.</B>

We do a hurried repacking on arrival to make sure that our cold weather gear
is handy. Lowland clothes to the bottom of the pack. I clear a space in the
stones to pitch the tents, wander around taking pictures. After a welcome
lie-down that ends up leaving me feeling even more exhausted, I'm unable to
eat what looks like an excellent pasta supper.

 Feeling nauseous, I lie in our tent while the others hold inconclusive
discussions about whether to go on tomorrow or turn back. Darlene is very
sick, has zipped herself into her tent, clearly unable to go on.

I'm wakened at midnight by Merle for another strategy discussion. We decide
to postpone any night-time departure until morning. No Uhuru summit at dawn
for us. Some idea about possibly staying put for another day to acclimatize.

<I>1214-18 </I> - <B>Dawn, final push for the summit.</B>

Now or never. We're wakened at 6am by Amani, our guide, with
the news that it won't be safe (or convenient?) to stay an extra day to
acclimatise. We do a hurried packing up. I actually feel much better this
morning, but facing breakfast is quite another thing.

I cram down a slice of french toast, but can't manage the 3 slices the cook
has put on my plate. Pretending to rummage for my diamox, aspirin and
anti-malaria, I wrap the remains of breakfast in a napkin and tuck it away
for future reference. Darlene is still sick. She'll have to go down with the
porters and join us at the next campsite.

We start up the Western Breach, moving very deliberately (read, slowly).

Shira Plateau and the Cathedral spire are visible in the background. This is
where we camped the previous two nights. Audra, Merle and Derek, with Amani,
the chief guide, and Oswald continue the zig-zag climb up the scree slope. 15
steps, rest, pant-pant. 10 steps, rest, puff-puff. 7 steps, gasp.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1214/1214-22.jpeg">
<I>1214-22 </I> - <B>Western Breach - 4</B>

We're making steady progress. Merle is ecstatic. Derek is happy, but still
nursing periodic bouts of nausea. Somewhere above here our "Platypus" water
bottles start to freeze up. You drink through a plastic tube leading into a
vinyl water bag stowed in the rucksack. Where the tube is open to the air,
it's vulnerable to freezing.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1214/1214-23.jpeg">
<I>1214-23 </I> - <B>Western Breach, below crater rim.</B>

I've been uncertain of our chances until this moment, when we attain a final
rock wall at the base of the caldera rim. Severely stressed by fatigue but
otherwise positive. Bright sun, azure sky, no wind. We've reached something
like 5500m (18,000 ft.) The top seems no more than 50 or 100 feet away. I'm
confident we'll make it, even if we have to crawl.

 We follow along the base of this rock wall for a bit, come to an irregular
gap, then clamber up a series of tumbled slabs and into the open on the
crater rim. Are we there yet? Our trekking poles are a nuisance at this
stage. You have to keep laying them down to get a two-handed grip on the
rocks. My pole threatens to slide away down the slope.

<I>1214-24 </I> - <B>Looking back down over the crater rim.</B>

Last night's campsite is somewhere near that bright patch in the centre. The
porters, who don't usually come up on the summit, have long since packed up
our camp and luggage, retreating with Darlene to lower levels for the trek
round the side of the mountain to our next camp on the way down.

<I>1214-25 </I> - <B>Catching breath, Uhuru summit, right.</B>

Here we're a little disconcerted at the remaining height still to be climbed:
Uhuru, the highest point on the caldera rim is still another 200m above us.
Nevertheless, I know we're going to make it now.

<I>1215-03 </I> - <B>Furtwangler Glacier, Kilimanjaro.</B>

Passing the Furtwangler Glacier, I throw a token snowball at Merle. I can
barely manage a pitch of about 20 feet. Feels more like the shot-put event.

That ice wall is at least 30 feet high, but we don't have the reserve energy
to pose anybody over there in front of it.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1215/1215-06.jpeg">
<I>1215-06 </I> - <B>Uhuru Peak, west rampart.</B>

Skirting the glacier, we head for this rampart of Uhuru Peak. The ground
underfoot has a moonscape feel, surprisingly neat and uniform. Until the
recession of the glaciers, it was likely under an almost stationary ice cap
for millenia. There are few signs of the extensive erosion you see on the
outer slopes of the mountain.

We get a better view of the Furtwangler Glacier and of the smooth,
dusty-looking surfaces within the caldera. That hill on the horizon is the
side of the main and probably most recently active crater on
the volcano.

Finally, up over the edge onto the very top of Uhuru Peak. A gentle slope
leads to the tacky summit signpost. I flop down to rest, with my Tilley hat
over my eyes.


3:15pm, getting late. We wait for Audra, who is pretty nearly exhausted. I
encourage her to be first onto the summit, since the original impetus for
this project came from her. Hugs, pictures.

Yes, we made it. Brilliant sunshine, amazing visibility, the clouds have all
gone. A few nights ago, we flew past this point in the regular KLM flight
from Amsterdam to Arusha. I remember watching the video screen readout of our
progress, with speed, temperature, altitude and position. We slowed down from
1000 Km/hr and dropped from cruising altitude to 6000m.
I recall noticing the outside temperature: -5 degrees Celsius, then -2
degrees and rising, and thinking, we can stand that, this planet is our
home. It's not outer space.

<I>1215-20 </I> - <B>Kilimanjaro: guides Amani and Oswald.</B>

Our guides, Amani and Oswald deserve a lot of the credit for getting us up
here. Not to mention the nameless porters who carried, tents, personal
luggage, food, charcoal, and an iron picnic table so we could be comfortable.

<I>1215-14u1 </I> - <B>Kilimanjaro summit.</B>

 In this summit panorama, you can see the Western Breach, the route of our
ascent from Arrow Glacier camp. Emerging over the smashed outer edge of the
caldera, we faced the Furtwangler Glacer. Following parallel to this, we made
the final ascent to the summit via the dark ravine on the left. In the
centre, the circular edge of the Reusch Crater is just visible.

 The crater still has vents emitting hot, sulphurous
gases. So Kilimanjaro is not dead, merely dormant.  On the right of
the valley lies the Kenya border, not far to the north. Being here and
experiencing the nearness of the elements, leaves ME in no doubt that this is
a holy place.

<I>1215-21 </I> - <B>The Southern Icefield</B>

Sometime around 3:30pm, we begin our gallop downhill, past the remnants of
the Southern Icefield. We've goto to lose a lot of altitude, fast. Dusk comes
shortly after 6pm. That leaves us about 3 hours of daylight to get out of
what COULD be called, a death-zone.

<BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/1215/1215-22.jpeg">
<I>1215-22 </I> - <B>The Southern Icefield</B>

We retreat down gradual slopes at first, along the rim of the caldera, past a
series of sun-sculpted glaciers, to a turnoff just before Stella Point. Here
the trail begins to dip more steeply. We're still looking out onto a layer of
woolly cloud stretching to the horizon.

<I>1215-25 </I> - <B>Descent at dusk.</B>

Its a very long and tedious route descending the scree slopes. We kick up a
tremendous dust and there's no breeze to carry it away. Like skiing, but I'd
really much rather take the chair-lift down. Muscles for the descent kick in,
different from those used on the ascent, but weakened from fatigue and
dehydration.

Audra has sprung a knee and her lung congestion has become acute.
She has one guide on each arm going down the worst parts.

This is the normal route up, but to my mind not very scenic. Mwenzi stays
visible for a while, but the sides of the valley block the wider view. Most
climbers would come up this way in the dark. Thank heaven we chose the
Western Breach route. And, in some ways, lucky too that we postponed the
ascent until after breakfast. Otherwise we'd have had no scenic views.

Finally, the Barafu hut, reached just after dusk. There we get
tea from another group  and stop to consider the situation. We
spend at least 30min. dithering in the hut about what to do for
Audra. Amani attempts to use a mobile phone with weak batteries.
The hut is full of other climbers and porters trying to sleep.
Eventually Amani decides we must walk down to the next camp in
the dark where our own porters expect meet us.

Onward with flashlights and headlamps in the dark. Every bush along the way
looks like a tent to our wishful eyes. All the way down, I begin to smell
french toast, barf, drink a mouthful of water and then feel fine again. Can't
figure out why the odour of greasy french toast is following me around. Some
mysterious hallucination of high altitude, perhaps.

We're met by a stretcher party part way down. They carry Audra, but this ends
up being even more uncomfortable and she has to begin walking again,
supported by one guide or porter on either side. We stumble into Millenium
camp close to midnight.

We've lost more than 1000m of altitude, but Audra is still having trouble
breathing. Her twisted knee is a wreck. Finally I discover why the odour of
french toast has been following me all day. At breakfast at the summit base
camp at the Arrow Glacier, I'd been unable to eat, except for one slice of
french toast crammed down the unwilling gullet. To avoid offending the cook,
I'd stashed two slices in a napkin in the outer netting of my backpack. Just
in case of emergencies. Smelling this on the way down triggered me into
barfing, quite a few times. But it wasn't really the french toast, more a
matter of fatigue and dehydration.

With a shudder, I pitch the toast outside the tent in the dark, just as my
headlamp batteries burn out. Into the sleeping bag just in time. The moral of
this story is: cast your french toast upon the waters (read, nearest
glacier), before you begin the ascent, or it will come back to haunt you
seven-fold.

Pedometer: 12-21.5=10.5mi. Dp 8:30am, in at 11:30pm=15hrs ascent and descent.

It's all an impressionistic blur on the way down.
Our last day on the mountain. My french toast has lain untouched on the ground
overnight despite a few rapacious ravens infesting the campsite. I now pitch
out my gaiters, along with the toast, since they haven't kept the scree out
of my boots. Feeling a little better this morning. Spartan regime of bikkies
and water today.

Gradual transition of zones, increase of humidity, song birds. Plenty of
small flowers, bright beside the path. Impatiens, just like at home, only
growing wild. Then into a region of tree ferns. Audra slightly better this
morning, knees still bad, lung congestion much less. Merle's knees a bit
sensitive toward the end.

We can't see much on the downgrade, too busy watching our footing.
The path in soft volcanic earth is deeply channeled by overuse. Sometimes we
walk in a mini ravine, knee deep.

I must be really tired. Only having the strength to take one blurry picture
today.

We arrive at the waiting Land Rover at dusk. Amani hands me a drink of orange
squash, some biscuit. Didn't barf once today.

Incredibly bumpy ride down a steep mountain trail. I count out porter money
in the bouncing dark while packed in with luggage, climbers, a park official,
guides and unidentified hangers-on. Good thing our own handlers are honest.
I have to hand Amani my whole stash so he can count it for me. At the end of
the ride, the porters sit waiting in the dark for their pay. They've
already been down for hours and they've been walking the whole distance with
loads to carry.

Back to Moshe in the Land Rover. Pedometer reading 21.5-6 = 9.5mi. 9am to 6pm
= 9hrs.

 Crickets and mosquitoes in the dining room
at the Hotel Buffalo. We cash more travellers' cheques today. Nearly a
millionaire. Got 880,000 TZS from $500 CDN in travellers' cheques, 400,000
shillings last time. The lady at the currency exchange recognises me and
seems surprised the old gaffer made it up the mountain. Russian veggies with
rice for dinner. They have a really nice menu at the Hotel Buffalo. But
they've upgraded the room rental. We're now paying $12 a night instead of 10.
With survival no longer an immediate issue, we're starting to savour trivial
domestic details once again.

Shortly after our return from the climb, we have dinner at our travel agent,

Need a bush shirt with more pockets, inside pockets especially,
not heavy fabric like the Tilley jacket. Trousers, shorts with
side pocket zippers, or other secure fasteners. Should waste
less time and have less anxiety pulling out fat wallets and
disentangling hidden money belts in public. Also need to solve
the problem of how to get a drink without taking off the pack.
Merle's "Platypus" mouthpiece and tube froze up on the summit of
Kili. The problem of getting enough to drink while nearly
exhausted may have contributed to my nausea.

best when .bmp's are specified. Due to space limitations, only
feasible over the network. Need improvements to beginning and

explanation.
 Would be nice to have a way to attach multiple soundclips to
the same file, displayed with multiple croppings. Without
having to create more space-eating versions.
 07-02-06: have begun re-editing pictures. now up to Shira Plateau. Improved

 09-11-03: Added Google satellite views.
 15-03-04: adjustments for HTML
 16-05-03: edits for ease of reading on tablet.

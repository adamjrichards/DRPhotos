<P>    Balancing his journal on his knees, Captain Ames considered
the patches of new snow that cloaked the shoulders of the
highest peaks. A few lingering rays of sun still lit the tops of
distant crags. He edged closer to the fire and clasped his
numbed fingers under his arms to take out the stiffness. Since
they'd left the prairies, a mood of finality had come over him,
of banking up fires, of affairs concluded and past events
requiring judicious summary. With the burden of day-to-day
command resting on Harris and Fielding, he felt altogether more
relaxed. Should have appointed them executive officers from the
very beginning. Let him get on with matters of more lasting value.
Reputations, for instance. At last he took out his pencil and
began to write.
<P>
<P>    Shortly after War-bow's encounter with Colonel Enright, the
weather had turned unusually cold and stormy, blocking the
passes and sending a premonition of winter through the heart of
every traveller and wandering Indian. But then, about ten days
later, a spell of warm, dry days had set in and persisted to the
end of October. Fielding and Harris (with Captain Ames
concurring) had decided it was now or never if they were to get
across the mountains and reach the headwaters of the Columbia
before winter. 
<P>    The Piegans were also on the move. As War-bow was leaving
the foothills with his American prisoners, Fielding had
extracted the Chief's promise to deliver the captives (better to
call them "survivors")-- and a sealed report addressed to the
authorities in Montreal -- to the nearest fur trading post for
eventual forwarding east.
<P>    Here the Captain looked up to consider what was suitable
for inclusion in the public record and what had best be buried
in his private diary.
<P>    From all accounts, the action had been a great success.
Colonel Enright had retired from the stage prematurely and in
some confusion, disappearing across an obscure southerly pass
before he could carry out his plan to penetrate the Athabaska
country. War-bow had recouped a considerable debt of honour in
horses, men and damaged pride for the Blackfoot nation. The Ames
Expedition had replenished its exhausted stores of powder and
other needed supplies from War-bow's booty.  And, according to
Harris, the interests of high policy in British North America
had been furthered to no small degree. The Admiral would surely
be satisfied. And that would further Ames' own hopes of
eventually publishing an account of the journey with the full
approval and financial support of the Society for the
Dissemination of Geographical Knowlege. Engraved illustrations,
tables, charts, the lot. Perhaps even a thick appendix with
interviews, excerpts from the diaries of others, even the
American survivors, if he could contact them.
<P>    Exactly what offence the Colonel's wranglers could be
charged with once they reached Montreal was open to doubt.
According to Fielding, they'd be speedily released, to find
their way south and tell some fabulous story of Indian savagery
to the readers of popular American newspapers. Well, the more
lurid the better. As for the Colonel himself, he'd be
hard-pressed to limp southward through the mountain valleys and
reach the overland route of Lewis and Clark before freeze-up. On
his return east, he'd have little to report that would encourage
future incursions of a similar nature. And yet he could always
be featured as a gallant though less successful rival. A colourful
member of the exploring fraternity. An object lesson in how
<I>not</I> to conduct a boundary survey.
<P>    They'd spent the last few days refining their own survey of
the foothill country while waiting for weather conditions in the
mountains to improve. Fielding's notebooks were overflowing with
measurements and calculations. It had been a part of their
instructions to search for a southerly pass which might carry
communications across the mountains into the central part of the
Columbia basin. This would avoid the necessity of a lengthy
detour to the north by way of Jasper's House. The Indians had
spoken of an easy route to the interior. It was a hint of this
that Fielding had tried to plant in Enright's mind by means of a
spurious heliograph message purporting to come from Maidstone.
The object had been to show the Colonel the door, so to speak.
To provide him with an avenue of departure and, courtesy of
War-bow, a compelling reason to take it. But it appeared that
the pass was either further north or south than the Indians
claimed, or that something had gone wrong with their rival's
pathfinding. So they'd decided to trace out the route and
determine the exact location for themselves.
<P>    Arriving at the scene of the ambush, Fielding had declared
himself horrified to count ten makeshift crosses stuck in the
gravel of the river bank. There was also the body they found
wedged in the rocks a half-mile downstream. War-bow's adoption
of modern tactics had been more effective than anticipated.
That, explained Harris, coupled with an extremely advantageous
set of circumstances, had turned an incident of minor Indian
harassment into a rout.
<P>    The Captain placed a discreet question mark in the margin of
his notebook. He'd have to review the manuscript backwards to
make sure it was quite clear to the reader that the -- how shall
we put it? -- "rough justice" of this sorry incident, sprang
from the "natural order of events" rather than from any
application of "high policy".
<P>    Today the British expediton had taken a route up the steep
side of the valley only a mile past the site of the graves. At
the top was a high alpine meadow just above the tree line. The
warm weather held and they risked making camp in the pass amid
the melting remains of premature snowdrifts. Under a brilliant
night sky of late season stars, they built-up the campfires and
settled down to sleep, disturbed only by the frosty night air
and gurgles of water draining down the mountain under loose
rocks.
<P>    At last the Captain put away his writing things and looked
upward at the night sky. His own conception of Divine Providence
had mellowed somewhat since his accommodation with Harris and
Fielding. After releasing his clawlike grip on the reins of
command, he'd felt a kind of benign fatalism. Farther from
control of his own life and others, but more reconciled to
eternity, nonetheless. He'd even enjoyed one or two long chats
with Fielding. The boy had tried to expound on the theme: "In my
father's house are many mansions." Wise beyond his years,
actually. Still carried that medicine bundle he'd received in
the Mandan village. Sharp little claws sticking out. Perhaps it
did some good, who could tell. But in any case, way up here,
they were far beyond the haunts of the burrowing owl ...
<P>
<P>                                                           ***
<P>
<P>    The following day, at Fielding's behest, it was decided not
to break camp immediately, but to take the opportunity to make a
few observations with the astronomical equipment. The weather
gave every sign of continuing calm and clear. The men were given
a day off to rest, or to lark about on nearby slopes. Captain
Ames was particularly interested in discovering fossilized
shells which might have a bearing on the Biblical story of a
universal deluge. They had sent him off with a crew of men to
carry specimens.
<P>    Fielding packed up the optical instruments and set off with
Midshipman Harris and three men on a tramp to a nearby peak
overlooking the country to the west. Crossing the surrounding
meadowland, the survey party struck off north along a gradually
ascending ridge.
<P>    "You know, Harris, it's odd that Enright should've chosen
this particular pass. It's only just barely feasible for pack
animals." He paused for a backward look. "Lost a couple more
horses yesterday."
<P>    They'd already climbed some three hundred feet above the
pass and could now see its saddle-like form, curved two ways --
up to the ridges on either side, down to the valleys at each
end. The camp was a series of specks on the meadow. Fielding
watched the insect-like figure of a trooper stroll away from the
browsing horses toward a westerly vantage point where the
interior valleys could be seen in all their grandeur.
<P>    Harris caught up to him, puffing and pink from the exertion.
"Probably a navigation error. I'm positive I sent the location
as 49 degrees, 30 minutes, sent it twice in fact. The entrance
to this pass is closer to 49 degrees, 50 minutes."
<P>    "Practically every trace obliterated," observed Fielding.
"Not even the usual whiskey bottles to blaze the trail."
<P>    "But they must have gotten across, somehow. War-bow's men
have been guarding the valley entrance all this time. No sign of
anyone coming out. ... I wouldn't agitate my brains about it.
The Colonel is probably far away to the south somewhere, well
below the boundary by now." 
<P>    "Boundary, what boundary?"
<P>    "49 degrees north latitude." The reply was given in the
matter-of-fact tone of one who merely reiterated the obvious.
<P>    "So you think it's a foregone conclusion? You realize, of
course, that our own people have already set up trading posts as
far south as the mouth of the Columbia?"
<P>    "They're not <I>our</I> people, dear chap. Those greedy Montreal
fur traders are <I>your</I> people. They'll never hold the entire
Oregon Territory anyway when real settlement begins."
<P>    "Why d'you say that?"
<P>    "It's bloody obvious. The overland route from the head of
the Missouri is getting busier every year.  It's a natural
highroad from the plains. The Americans would surely go to war
before they let us encroach on a main artery. A straight line
west from Lake-of-the-Woods is probably the simplest thing all
round."
<P>    "You're beginning to sound far too accommodating, Harris. I
can't see any straight lines from up here. What's the point of
it all, the expedition, the scheming, if the Americans are given
the best part of the Columbia basin?"
<P>    "Think of it realistically, Fielding. At least we'll have
deterred them from taking everything north to Alaska."
<P>    "Harris, I <I>have</I> been thinking realistically ... about
those graves back there. I wouldn't have guessed that giving
War-bow a little 'tactical assistance', as you put it, would
have such a devastating effect."
<P>    "Well, there <I>was</I> the 'little' matter of a dozen muskets.
And most of the remnant of our powder. That <I>was</I> a bit of a
gamble for us, wasn't it? ... And what about War-bow himself?
For his time and place, the man's a military genius. Picked his
terrain like a marshall. Not to mention Fox, here, as his
Sergeant-major. ... And myself to hide in the bushes and keep an
eye on things." 
<P>    "All the same, you and I are the ones who armed him. It's
all very well shrugging our shoulders and being flexible. But
while we're gadding about the world making corpses, we should
bloody well accomplish something useful to show for it."
<P>    Harris sat down and pulled out his pipe, waving to the men
lugging boxes of instruments. "Fox, why don't you and the others
dash on ahead and rest a bit while we stop and get our
bearings?" When the men were out of earshot, he continued,
looking Fielding squarely in the face.
<P>    "Consider this: Four of our own men have been killed,
including Sergeant-Major Crocker, who on your own account cannot
be replaced by any other non-commissioned officer in the entire
British Army. Perhaps a dozen of Enright's men were killed in
the pass. By our own count and War-bow's, at least fifteen
Indians have been killed by Enright's men, not including seven
or eight by us at Enright's instigation. A murder was committed
under my very nose with, I believe, the express purpose of
precipitating hostilities ... a scheme that failed only by the
narrowest margin in getting us massacred. All this, as the
direct or indirect result of the Colonel's 'forthright' policy
toward us, the natives and the territory. And then there's the
somewhat convoluted logic of our own backers to think about. ...
Shall I go on?" 
<P>    "No."
<P>    "Then why not allow the dead to decompose in peace? We'll
all be mouldering corpses soon enough. Come on, let's catch up
with the others." 
<P>    Harris was being callous again. But he was right. They'd
done their best and still reaped the usual mixed reward of good
and bad luck. The more Fielding thought about it, the more he
began to feel that special absolution from sin enjoyed by those
who contemplate the unravelling of Fate with unblinking eyes.
War-bow, Ames, everyone, had acted for the best -- in their own
peculiar way. Even the Colonel had carried things off with a
certain flair, up to the point of War-bow's attack. Then
something had gone dreadfully wrong. Fielding stared up the
ridge at the distant figures of the men perched high on a rock,
waiting to resume their advance. Perhaps the evil lay, not so
much in any particular lapse, as in the Colonel's failure to
view events from a high enough vantage point.
<P>    An autumn sun burned out of a cold blue heaven and the vast
bulk of the mountain seemed to thrust them skyward. The day had
a fine sense of unfolding destiny, and the certainty that all
Fate's decrees would eventually be fulfilled, one way or
another, drove his imagination resolutely upward, even while he
felt a lingering sense of kinship to the many victims of
Enright's ambition, now lying in their scattered graves. 
<P>    The survey party advanced steadily up a ridge consisting of
one monolithic, upturned slab. On the east it slanted down in an
even incline of 45 degrees to a distant sea of treetops. On the
west it terminated abruptly in a sheer plunge to a slope of
pulverized stone. At its higher levels the slab was bare of soil
and vegetation, except where a chance collection of debris in
some sheltered crack permitted the survival of a few hardy
plants. But these were browned with the effects of night-time
frost, while the deeper clefts were already filled with pockets
of snow.
<P>    "Harris, look how the layers stretch clear up to the peak.
Then all the way down into the forest. It's hard to believe the
side of a mountain could be so flat. What does it remind you
of?" 
<P>    "I can tell you one thing. I'd just as soon you didn't drag
me up here in the middle of winter. There'd be nothing to cling
to. We'd slide down on the ice, digging in our nails and
shrieking all the way." 
<P>    "That's it, Harris. Remember the St. Lawrence River at
Montreal? those huge ice floes piled up on shore? The pressure
of the moving ice pushed them up on edge. There must be a
comparison somewhere. This layer of rock we're standing on could
have been reared up by the same kind of forces." 
<P>    Harris stepped aside to examine something. "See that?
Fossilized sea shells in the rock." He traced the spiral pattern
of a shell for Fielding to see. "Some ancient philosopher --
Xenophanes, I think -- found the same thing on a mountain top in
Greece. He had his own theory. Let's hear what an Upper Canadian
has to say." There was a touch of satire in his tone, but not
unkindly.
<P>    "Raised from the sea bed on this slab?"
<P>    Despite Harris' jibes, something was taking root in
Fielding's mind: a theory surrounded by the luminosity of a
spiritual revelation. He stared at his companion with new
awareness, a sensation compounded of jealousy, and deep respect
for one who could stimulate this feeling. 
<P>    "Very good, I shall recommend you for membership in the
Royal Society. Just so long as you don't go expounding your
ideas to Captain Ames." Fielding stared as Harris lectured.
<P>    "Yes, prospecting for fossils on mountain tops is innocent
enough -- if you accept that they were deposited by a receding
deluge. But if you claimed they'd been <I>pushed</I> skyward out of
the mud, like so many pebbles sticking to an up-ended ice floe,
then you'd be in for rough sailing. The distinction is
important. You wouldn't need a heaven-sent flood in the Fielding
cosmology, would you? Aeons of slow movement in the rocks would
do it. You'd have no need of a subsidence of the waters to
explain the presence of a sea shell, high and dry on a mountain
top. And if you didn't need a flood, perhaps you mightn't need
the Bible either."
<P>    "Then you believe the Genesis story might be only a ..."
<P>    "... A myth, an edifying fable? Why not? You practically
said as much yourself when we were discussing Lone Man and his
flood at the Mandan village. I expect you could dig up all sorts
of ancient stories about creations and deluges."
<P>    "What stories, Harris? Where could I read about such things?
You never did say when we spoke of it before."
<P>    They strolled to the edge of the precipice, Fielding
experiencing a heady intimation of flight, of ideas taking wing,
of a mind that could span that gulf of air and soar alone across
mountain ranges in the sunset and come to rest on the far shore
of an infinite ocean. He looked at Harris and felt a sudden urge
to take his irritating friend by the hand, to clasp him to his
bosom one last time ... and to say "Goodbye and fare ye well"
before they spoiled everything with a decisive falling-out.
Harris looked expectantly back at him. Fielding stood immobile,
waiting for some impulse to move him. Harris continued:
<P>    "... My father once met a man who'd been working for years
to translate an ancient stone. He said it was inscribed in three
languages, sent back by Napoleon from Egypt. ..."
<P>    "Your father?" Fielding interrupted his own reverie to break
into Harris'. "Do you realize this is the first time I've ever
heard you refer to your father?" 
<P>    "Yes."
<P>    Harris did not elaborate further.
<P>
<P>    They continued their ascent of the ridge, following the
fractured edge of the upturned slab as if it were some wild
shoreline in the sky. They skirted a bay hundreds of yards wide
and thousands of feet deep. Further on, they trod a promontory
jutting outward into space, overhanging a sea of empty air.  On
the sloping side of the slab, they watched as an eagle flapped
tireless wings and ascended the slope, skimming toward them a
few feet above the surface. At the top edge it teetered
momentarily on an invisible fulcrum of air, then gathered speed
and soared out over the void with ease, till it hung motionless
against blue valleys in the west. 
<P>    Some two miles from camp they reached a decisive barrier to
further progress -- the first real obstruction in a continuous
upward march.
<P>    "Might as well set up the instruments right here," said
Harris in resignation. "Surely we're high enough by now." 
<P>    Fielding strongly disagreed. "What? come all this way and
stop short of the summit? You don't mean it. ... I'm going on."
<P>    "You should emigrate to Switzerland then. They have
crackpots there who do this sort of thing for pay -- merely to
accommodate eccentric English travellers in search of vacuous
prospects."
<P>    "Really? You mean to say they get to climb mountains for a
living? I think that's ... rather wonderful. ... Well, it <I>is</I>
extraordinary, you have to admit."
<P>    Fielding glanced covertly at his companion. He was sensitive
to Harris' teasing that his professional motives were basically
recreational at heart. And yet, mountain climbing wasn't really
'extraordinary', not in the slightly disapproving sense one used
that term. He could well imagine himself doing it for a living,
but he wouldn't let on, in case Harris devastated him with
satire. 
<P>    A stone rampart fortified the top of the mountain, blocking
further advance. The men laid down their burdens and began to
stretch weary muscles. 
<P>    "How're we supposed to get up that?" Fox's voice, normally
confident, was now querulous. "It overhangs on this side, and
falls ten thousand feet on the other." 
<P>    Harris concurred. "Yes, looks like a layer of rock about
forty feet thick with at least ten feet of overhang on this
side. Only a spider could get up there, <I>if</I> it survived the
perishing cold."
<P>    "It's not cold, Harris. It's <I>fresh</I>. Feel how warm those
rocks are where the sun's been on them."
<P>    Fielding viewed the obstacle from closer up. He couldn't let
a mere forty feet of vertical ascent deter him. This cap of rock
sat on the very peak of the mountain. From a distance it had
seemed like only another thin layer on top of the surface they
were climbing. But now he could see that they were faced with
edges rising at right angles away from the sloping main slab,
creating an impossible overhang.  Leaving the others to rest, he
worked his way round the bottom of this tilted wall, searching
for a convenient crack to ascend. Unfortunately, the overhang
seemed to go right the way round the top of the mountain and he
returned to his companions in disappointment. 
<P>    "Oh, do give it up, Fielding. We don't want to get stuck up
here and catch our death from frostbite. Remember that time on
Mt. St. Hilaire near Montreal? I expect the odds in favour of
salvation are much poorer here, even though we're probably a
good mile closer to heaven." 
<P>    Fielding advanced as far as he could up the edge of the main
slab. The drop on the left was at least three thousand feet to
the nearest rocks below. And on his right, a paltry forty feet
of vertical barrier. But in between the two, where the outside
edge of the cap met the rim of the main slab, lay a possible
route. If he fell, it would be a mere forty feet of slithering
drop, hardly a lethal risk. There was, however, that additional
three thousand feet of yawning space but a single bounce to the
left. 
<P>    He grasped the first handholds with a wildly beating heart.
But the route turned out to be easy, apart from an awesome
exposure to empty space. He soon clambered to a point where he
could reach above the topmost edge and haul himself up. Looking
down, it was difficult to imagine being stopped by so trivial an
obstacle.  On future climbs he'd bring longer ropes, portable
ladders and steel-shod staves to avoid any similar
embarrassment.
<P>    Peering down at the others from his lordly perch, he was
aware for the first time that day of a new advantage over his
brilliant companion.
<P>    "Come on, Harris. Do get on with it. That's it. Move the
other foot. A little to the left. No, NO! not there. <I>Higher</I>.
That's it.  Now, you, Fox, tie the end of the rope to that
instrument case, carefully." 
<P>    They clung to the uppermost ledges of the peak with a cold
breeze ruffling their hair. The warm, reassuring body of the
mountain, which up to then had lain close in front of them,
ready to support a clutching hand, now fell away on all sides.
On the very top they were left with a crouching, weak-kneed
feeling of terrible exposure and vulnerability. Fielding seated
himself carelessly on the brink, legs dangling over the abyss.
Harris remained a discreet distance back from the edge, an empty
pipe clamped upside-down in his teeth, attempting to look
nonchalant. Fox and the two troopers laboured to set up the
telescope on the sloping surface, their movements a study in
nervous deliberation. 
<P>    "Mind you prop it up carefully," warned Fielding, "it's a
long way down to the bottom. And I don't think we'll find a
mechanic to fix it between here and London." But the men were
too well aware of the risks to make any exuberant moves. 
<P>    Harris picked nervously at a loose flake of rock. "I think
I'll just clean out this crack. Give us a safer place to sit and
dig in our heels." He pried up a thirty pound chunk and tipped
it carefully over the edge. "Listen. ..." They cocked their ears
for several minutes but never did hear the final impact.
<P>    "D'you really think that's clever, old boy?" said Fielding.
"... Yes, wasn't the Captain strolling directly beneath,
gathering fossils." Harris stared at him with panic in his eyes,
till he realized that Fielding, for once, was teasing <I>him</I>.
"Frightfully sorry to have alarmed you, Harris. <I>Now</I> I
remember. Captain Ames went in the opposite direction."
<P>    Fielding turned to stare out over the valleys to the west. A
wasp lit on the rock beside his hand. He watched it clean its
antennae and pause to rest on the warm surface. The names of the
parts of that intricately-fashioned body, he must learn them,
compare their diversity with the specialized forms of other
insects. How did it survive the cold nights? Where did it make
its home? Not at this altitude, surely. The insect launched into
the air, circled his head and vanished into the void.  Its nest,
a whole colony of wasps, would be invisible a mere hundred feet
down the cliff face. A village, an army even, might be
undetectable from this height. 
<P>    And yet, right in front of him was a universe teeming with
invisible life: plants, animals and men, all merged in distance.
Somewhere in those smoky valleys, tribes of Indians, their
existence unknown to the outside world, hunted food, erected
wigwams, lived and died in happy oblivion while these sky-borne
eyes watched from above and prepared to link their world with
another. Fielding experienced a powerful urge to be part of that
linkage, whatever the consequences, to swoop down from his perch
and satisfy an almost erotic desire to investigate, to
circumnavigate, to enter and savour unknown territory. At that
moment, for him alone, to know all there was to know ... was a
consummation devoutly to be wished.
<P>    "Now there's something odd," observed Harris. "Can you see
that column of smoke to the north-west?" His eye remained glued
to the eyepiece of the telescope. "At least ten or fifteen miles
off as the eagle flies. A hundred on foot, I'd wager." Fielding
came over and seated himself beside the instrument's carrying
case. "Hand me that other eyepiece and I'll see if I can't
increase the magnification." Harris reassembled the optics and
adjusted the focus. "There, have a look for yourself." 
<P>    On the shore of a small lake, far to the north-west, a
column of smoke rose vertically, hung in the air and dispersed
downwind in an even layer.  Silhouetted against an indistinct
background of dark forest, the plume rose up from within a log
palisade of uncertain design and ramshackle construction. Above
its walls, with the image upside-down in the telescope's
eyepiece, floated the Stars and Stripes.

<P> Owls, with recorded commentary (original)
<P>Scans are from early black and white hand-scanner. Same time as Temple Tikvah
bulletin.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL1.jpeg">
OWL1  - Barred Owl</P>

<P>The Barred owl is forever debarred from polite society. No one knows why.
And the owl is wisely saying nothing.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL10.jpeg">
OWL10  - Temperance Owl</P>

<P>This Temperance owl is guarding an empty glass -- misguidedly.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL11.jpeg">
OWL11  - Bon-vivant Owl</P>

<P>The Bon-vivant owl has had a few too many.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL3.jpeg">
OWL3  - Long-eared Owl</P>

<P>The Long-eared owl has a knack for overhearing gossip.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL4.jpeg">
OWL4  - Great Grey Owl</P>

<P>The Great Grey owl is neither great nor gray ...
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL2.jpeg">
OWL2  - Great Grey Owl, surprised</P>

<P>but surprised that you think so.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL5.jpeg">
OWL5  - Owl of Athena</P>

<P>The Owl of Athena is worried that you may find out the secret
of its wisdom ...
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL5R.jpeg">
OWL5R  - Owl of Athena, reversed</P>

<P>which is, that it has eyes, like the god Janus, on both sides of
its head.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL7.jpeg">
OWL7  - Predatory Owl</P>

<P>The Predatory owl thinks that a mouse dinner would be a real hoot.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL8.jpeg">
OWL8  - Inebriated Owl</P>

<P>The Inebriated owl is a close relative of the Bon-vivant owl,
but has given up all hope of respectability.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL9.jpeg">
OWL9  - Bump-on-a-log Owl</P>

<P>The Bump-on-a-log owl gets a reputation for wisdom by merely looking
<P>confused and saying very little -- wisely.
<P>{#}  End of the owl show. Hit <esc> to finish.

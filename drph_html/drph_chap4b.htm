<P>    "Surely Captain Ames must at least be aware that the man is
an American agitator." James looked over his shoulder to see if
the crewman behind him was listening, then hunched closer to
Harris. "Actually, Sometimes I'm more worried about Captain Ames
than Mr. Maidstone. Our own leader could turn out to be the
greatest threat to the success of this expedition."
<P>    "Yes, but do pipe down," murmured Harris. "We <I>are</I> in
company, such as it is." Then he brightened up and deliberately
raised his voice a trifle. "Well, you and Mrs. Maidstone came
back just in time. One more day and we'd have gone on without
you. And then, where'd you have been? Camped out in the
wilderness with that carnivorous blue-stocking."
<P>    James' friend apparently thought it acceptable to speak
banteringly about other people's private affairs in public, but
not to take seriously a matter touching on the welfare of
everyone in the expedition.
<P>    "I really wish you'd not refer to her in that sarcastic
way."
<P>    "Still feeling a little <I>tender</I> are we?"
<P>    "Harris!"
<P>    "Yes, Mr. Fielding." 
<P>    "Do shut up. I actually <I>heard</I> Enright and Maidstone
plotting aboard the <I>Progress</I>. I tell you we've been sabotaged,
and by our one of our own people. Maidstone and Major Snell were
the ones who got Ames appointed." James swept his eyes across
the canoe brigade and fixed on the Captain in his canoe. "If
they wanted to put someone perfectly loveable but ineffective in
command, they've succeeded."
<P>    "Don't lecture me about the facts, James. I was with you in
Montreal the night Maidstone's bully boy pitched the knife at
us, remember? Apparently, you still don't realise the full
implications of the situation. We face a serious threat.
But we have to act dumb. There's absolutely nothing to
justify making accusations in public."
<P>    "Well, why don't we just give it all up and turn back then?"
<P>    "Do try to think it through. Picture what would happen if we
tried put in a report to the proper authority. 'Look here,
Captain Ames, we've discovered information suggesting that this
expedition is being led down the garden path' ...? You see? It's
out of the question, especially since Ames has shown himself
perfectly competant at leading us down the garden path, so far."
<P>    "I do grasp the problem, Harris."
<P>    Why did James feel he had to battle his friend for
proprietorship of the expedition's problems? Weren't there
enough challenges to go round? He politely refrained from
reminding Harris of his own original discovery of Enright's
papers, or of that odd exchange of prisoners on Lake Ontario
when he'd met Maidstone, alias Sullivan, for the first time.
Parts of the knotted skein lay in his own hand and he felt
compelled to search for the loose ends himself. He continued:
<P>    "I really wish Maidstone would try some definite mischief.
After everything that happened to you at Landry's Bay, the peace
and quiet of the last few days is simply unreal. And Mrs.
Maidstone is all sweetness and light, and will I please carry
her paintbox. Maidstone himself was actually civil to me this
morning. And Captain Ames is a cheerful old Trojan hobby-horse
who doesn't even suspect that he's nothing but a hollow shell."
<P>    "Oh, I say, good image. Someday you'll make a fine
illustrator of children's books ..."
<P>    "Shut up, Harris. Maidstone actually showed Enright a copy
of our secret orders. I saw that much with my own eyes. Now
they'll anticipate our every turn. ... Or is this all a little
too obvious? Are we being <I>had</I> at an even higher level?"
<P>    "Very good, convoluted reasoning at last. I like that. What
d'you think would happen if we formally confronted Maidstone
with illegal possession of official secrets? We might be able to
get him locked up for a time in Fort William. <I>If</I> he still has
the papers on him. What if we filched them for ourselves?
Wouldn't mind having a packet of secret orders in my own pocket.
Might come in extremely handy at some later date. Hmm ..."
<P>    "And by the way, how do we really know those papers are the
genuine article?" Could there be some <I>other</I> reason why the
have our secret orders? Besides simply allowing them to predict
our movements?"
<P>    "Surely Maidstone wouldn't stoop to an elaborate forgery
merely to impress Enright. Unless ... someone <I>else</I> had good
reason to plant false information. Major Snell, perhaps?
<P>    "Hold that thought, Harris. ... Now, remember the day we
visited the Admiral's rooms? Didn't he say something about
holding a portion of our orders in abeyance? And he implied
quite positively that we'd be going all the way to the Pacific
Ocean. And yet, the last thing I heard Enright say was that we
were hanging about on the Red River. And then I fell into the
water."
<P>    "Something fishy back there on Georgian Bay. I mean, besides
James Fielding."
<P>    "Definitely. We'd best keep a watchful eye on the old man
and his portable writing desk. Guard against any further
possibility of documents falling into the wrong hands."
<P>    "And maintain a languorous gaze on Maidstone, and Mrs.
Maidstone. ... Though I <I>would</I> suggest a little less languor
in the latter case."
<P>    James certainly agreed with the need to maintain a close
watch on Maidstone. But he didn't tell Harris about the "little
disruption" he'd heard Maidstone mention to Enright. It would
only encourage his friend to make further embarrassing remarks.
<P>    Across the waters in a distant canoe, the "little
disruption" at issue was demurely busy with her embroidery on a
square of white linen. James closed his eyes. He could still
recapture the glorious feeling of gliding across those slopes of
snowy flesh. The rapturous sensation almost made him black out
and he had to force his eyes open to dispel dizzyness.
<P>    Before him, the open waters of Superior were still rolling
steadily out of the west. But the steersman was already prospecting
the rocky coast for an inlet where they could camp for the
night.
<P>
<P>  ***  
 
<P>    The brigade had penetrated a deep cove, a secret harbour on
the eastern Superior shore. As the Captain stood on the beach
looking around him, he felt a twinge of distaste. The place was
so luxuriantly wild, so complacently isolated. A safe anchorage
in a storm, no doubt, but even on an inland expedition he
retained his shipman's distaste for a lee shore.
<P>    The headlands of the narrow inlet swept upward, bare of
vegetation where the rocks were exposed to the battering of the
lake. At the head of the cove they set up camp on a sandy beach.
A scattering of driftwood and tree roots, weathered silver by
the sun, marked the high-water level. Directly back of the sand,
protected by the high flanks of iron hills, rose a dense spruce
forest.
<P>    Captain Ames bent over, crawled stiffly into his tent and
began to rustle about inside. His posterior was sticking
embarrassingly out the door when he heard Seargeant Crocker
clear his throat.
<P>    "Beggin' your pardon, Captain, but Mr. Maidstone wants to
see you. Says 'e won't take no for an answer."  Sensing a spot
of bother, the Sergeant hastily withdrew to supervise the piling
of stores. The Captain emerged from the tent holding a notebook
and writing things.
<P>    "Ah, Maidstone, there you are. A secluded setting, is it
not?" He motioned to a driftwood log and settled himself,
beckoning his guest to follow suit. "Not much in the way of
amenity, but I expect you've become accustomed to the privations
of travel, as have we all. And your good wife?"  Maidstone
looked back with watchful eye. "I trust she's bearing up under
the rigours of the journey?" 
<P>    Maidstone's fixed stare made the Captain uncomfortable and
he decided to be brisk. "In consideration of your earlier
remarks, sir, I am prepared to make some minor investigation of
the matter. ... I trust you can be more specific in your
allegations?" 
<P>    "Captain, it's an open secret. He inflicts his attentions on
her at every opportunity. I demand that something be done." 
<P>    "Tut, sir, 'open secret', indeed. Why am I not a party to
this 'open secret' as you call it?  I have eyes and ears, man.
Harris, Fielding, the lot of them, all at her beck and call,
even Crocker. She lifts her pretty hand to gather one precious
stick of firewood; they flock to gather ten. She steps from her
canoe; the arms stretch forth to form a living couch. They
convey her to shore from her barge of state like the Queen of
Sheba. Allow me, in all civility, to suggest that you see to
her governance yourself."
<P>    Maidstone flushed at the rebuff. "I <I>am</I> prepared to
tolerate the attentions of your pack of louts, Captain. But my
patience wears thin at the unusual devotion of Mr. Fielding.  I
find the lady's independence trying enough, without her being
regularly intercepted by that young puppy on the pretext of
carrying her paint box." 
<P>    "But surely, sir, you have no objection to your wife, or to
my staff for that matter, recording our progress by sketching?
It is part of the duty of a staff officer."
<P>    A peal of joyous sound echoed from the walls of the inlet.
They both looked round to see the lady in question standing at
the far end of the beach in the centre of an admiring group. Her
head was thrown back. Harris was pointing at a bird high up in
the sky. Fielding was doubled up with laughter. And Sergeant
Crocker was walking away with his hands in the air, apparently
the willing butt of some excruciating joke.
<P>    "It's not really the sketching, Captain Ames. It's the
private art lessons," hissed Maidstone. "In fine weather, hardly
an evening passes when they don't go off to sit on some rock
painting sunsets ... and stay to see the sunrise." His tone
became venomous. "You must put an end to the boy's attentions
before I'm forced to do so myself." 
<P>    The Captain sighed. "As you requested, I have already spoken
to Fielding about pestering the lady.  But I hesitate to comply
with the full force of your request. Are you suggesting that I
forbid officers and men to take any notice of her whatever? That
would have the effect of raising more questions than it would
settle. A most peculiar prohibition calling forth the most
unsavoury gossip. And if the reasons you suggest were given, I
should become a laughingstock. Think of it, sir: 'All hands
confined to quarters in order to prevent an outbreak of <I>art
appreciation</I>.'
<P>    He paused to let Maidstone appreciate the dilemma, then
added with the air of a benign judge summing up. "Why not simply
take leave of us and rejoin the vanguard of the brigade? You
have a clear run to Fort William. Pay your canoe men handsomely.
Press on and regain lost time. Be done with our importunities."
<P>    Maidstone ignored the suggestions. His eyes ceased their
shifting and he fixed Captain Ames with a sickly smile.
<P>    "I'm afraid it's gone too far for that."
<P>    "What d'you <I>mean</I>, sir?"
<P>    "I mean, Captain, that certain improprieties may already
have occurred since our stop at Landry's Bay. <I>You</I> appear to be
quite impervious to the attractions of womanhood. I take it you
are not insensible to a question touching the honour of one of
your officers." 
<P>    "<I>May</I> have occurred, you say? Improprieties?  Sir, the
honour of my officers cannot be questioned without
substantiation. Leave me this instant. ... Till you have ample
evidence in support of your allegations."  The infuriated
Captain pointed down the beach toward the rest of the group.
"And kindly inform Mr. Fielding that his superior officer wishes
a word with him. <I>Immediately</I>." 
<P>    Maidstone lingered, favouring Captain Ames with a
heavy-lidded smile. All traces of anger seemed unaccountably to
have evaporated. "Thoroughly dacent of you, Captain. I'll just
be seeing about that evidence now." His voice had an unexpected
touch of Irish in it as he turned to stroll carelessly down the
beach.
<P>
<P>    The Captain was scribbling feverishly in his journal when
James put in an appearance. "You wished to see me, sir?" 
<P>    "At this moment, Fielding, I am confident that neither of us
really wishes to see the other." He began harshly enough, but
relented at once and resumed on a gentler note. "Mr. Maidstone
has come within a hair's breadth of making serious charges
against you, my boy.  I do not appreciate being forced to
adjudicate the personal squabbles of my staff." He fixed James
with the look of a disappointed parent. 
<P>    "No, sir."
<P>    "But I fear the matter of your conduct toward Mrs. Maidstone
is threatening to advance from importunity to impropriety." 
<P>    "Yes, sir. I mean no, sir."
<P>    "You were born in the colony, were you not? I have heard
your father, Captain Fielding, well spoken of. A man who raised
himself through his own efforts. And Major Snell has informed me
of your diligence at military studies. Nevertheless, there are
topics in which your background appears markedly deficient."
<P>    The Captain rolled his eyes heavenward and began again.
"There are matters, Fielding, that require the judgement of
someone -- not only senior in rank -- but senior in experience.
Let me give you an example. The fair sex ... such as Mrs.
Maidstone over there ..."
<P>    Nodding down the beach to where the others were still
chatting with the lady, he stared a trifle overlong, as if to
verify for himself a fact that seemed too obvious to be true.
<P>    "She certainly <I>is</I> an example, isn't she?" 
<P>    "Of what, sir?"
<P>    James was being most unhelpful while Captain Ames groped for
suitable terms to express his reservations about womankind in
general and Mrs. Maidstone in particular.
<P>    "Dash it, man, of the <I>fair sex</I>. She's a highly-strung
thoroughbred, as any fool can plainly see. She's not in full
control of her own emotions. Her nature plays tricks though she
probably means no harm. Women like that have a way of unhinging
the strongest constitutions. Don't even know they're doing it
half the time. And you, sir, you'll run your frail barque onto
the shoals -- <I>if</I> you fail to pay due attention to navigation."
<P>    "Yes, sir."
<P>    "She's a false fire, James. A beacon set up on a rocky coast
to lure you to your doom. ... Should you fail to steer the true
course."
<P>    The Captain began to warm to his subject, searching for
those inspiring metaphors that might appeal to a young man of
tender sensibility.
<P>    "The true course, sir?"
<P>    "Walk humbly with the Lord and do your duty, my boy. Help
the lady to overcome the weakness in her nature. And for your
own part, search heart and scripture for the example of our
Lord's Apostles. You can do no better than walk in the footsteps
of St. Paul. And take up the mission that has fallen to your
lot."
<P>    "Mission, sir?"
<P>    "Consider this: we've been given a rare opportunity to chart
a new overland route across the western continent. Like St.
Paul, we follow a path toward the setting sun. (Or was it the
rising sun? Damme, can't seem to remember my geography of Syria
and Lebanon.) And we too, in a manner of speaking, may catch a
glimpse of that same flash of light on the road to our own
Damascus.
<P>    "We toil onward in the hope that one day all this land may
be linked in Christian brotherhood from sea even unto shining
sea." The Captain's eyes shone. "Think of it, my boy: Canada --
the the British Throne of David to the north; and America -- the
great Republic of Enlightenment to the south (<I>In God We Trust.</I>
Remember that slogan when you are feeling uncharitable toward
the politics of our American neighbours.)
<P>    "Both realms, spiritual and political, finally united,
washed, nay <I>baptised</I> by the mighty Atlantic and Pacific on
either hand ..."
<P>    He came back to earth with a start. Fielding was now staring
at him with a look of irreligious scepticism <I>and</I> alarm. But
the Captain had been well briefed at the last minute by Major
Snell and the Governor. Sensibly warned off any extracurricular
adventuring in the sunset of his career.
<P>    "Ahem, ... I fear that I've exceeded even the Admiral's
expectations for the success of this expedition. ... I spoke
metaphorically, just then. In all practical matters relating to
our mission, sobriety will prevail. From this time forward, you
will be punctilious in attending Mrs. Maidstone with no more
than the minimum civility.  You will not wait upon the lady out
of sight of this company. Is that clear? Do you have a Bible,
Fielding? No? ... As I suspected. Then you may borrow mine for
your moral reclamation during the remainder of our journey." He
turned to fetch the volume from the interior of his tent. 
<P>    Captain Ames hunted through his luggage for the Bible,
sincerely moved by his own rhetoric. And digging through his
meagre belongings, he experienced again the loneliness of a
youngest son, prematurely thrust into the world to make his
fortune. Many years past, his family's old chapel-going nurse
had urged him to remember his devotions when he'd set out to
join his first ship as a junior midshipman. He'd not taken her
advice until much older and much less confident in his own
powers. And now he felt a keen sense of separation from that
long-dead world. But he could still remember muttering those
childish prayers, kneeling by his bed with the old woman
prompting when he forgot the words. The young man outside the
tent was in much the same vulnerable position. Except for one
thing. Fielding had an alarming tendency to blunder into
uncharted tropic waters where young Ames had never dared
venture. He emerged and handed James the Bible.
<P>    "A final word, Fielding, regarding Maidstone's allegations.
Are you prepared to state categorically that no impropriety has
taken place between you and the lady since we departed Landry's
Bay?"
<P>    The Captain stared fixedly at James. The boy's gaze wavered
but did not make the error of turning aside.
<P>
<P>    James stared back at the Captain. Full into the face of the
well-intentioned man he knew had been appointed as the innocuous
caretaker of a potentially crucial expedition. And now his own
peccadillos as well Ames' prosaic failings were on the table
between them. His mind hung precariously on the phrases: "no
impropriety ... <I>since</I> we departed Landry's Bay". He felt again
the recurring horror of clinging to an exposed rock face, his
toes dug into a diminishing crack, his vitals squeezed bloodless
in the determination to maintain balance.
<P>    "Can you give me your assurance?" repeated the Captain.
<P>    "I can, sir," he said at last.
<P>    Dismissed by Captain Ames, he shuffled along the beach
carrying the Bible. He was uncertain whether he'd found his way
forward to safer ground, or plunged backward into an abyss of
deceit.

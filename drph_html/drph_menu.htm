<P><P><B>Derek's Photo Portfolios</B>
<P> * Major projects, vacations
<P> * >))) = Slide shows with sound. Available on WWWB browser and MP4 movies.
<P> * Special projects, ongoing themes
<P> * Annual year albums
<P> * Numerous individual camera card and film portfolios. These consist of
selections from the basic camera file input, plus a few preliminary comments.
They are usually less edited than the special projects. Some of the annual
albums and vacation shows overlap or duplicate the original camera card
portfolios. This permits a selection of pictures in better narrative order
than the original taking sequence.
<P> * Camera card portfolios go back to the 1950s.
<P> * A few family albums have pictures from the 1920s.

Turtle Mountains

<P>        He leaned back in the saddle and stared upward. A black
disk of cloud, swirling at the edges, hung over them, its top
piled miles high with nimbus. A tongue of fire licked down from
the centre and was gone in a flicker, its prey a cluster of
trees twenty yards to the right. A sapling toppled over
emitting a cloud of steam. Infinitesimally delayed, the impact
of the sound exploded from the inside of his skull to echo off
the dark roof of cloud. 
<P>        "Near one, that," remarked Sergeant Crocker, reaching

clung swayed in the breeze.   The vast shadow passed over and
the sun shone down as before.

<P>    He shot a glance over the edge of his glass while he played
for time and pretended to enjoy the wine. It struck him as funny
that such a smooth flavour should bring back the kind of memories
he'd just as soon forget. In fact, it was a cask of this same
Madeira wine that his father had used to buy him out of an
American jail in the summer of 1815, nearly two years before.
<P>    "You'd better get on with your story, or we'll be anchoring
off Honolulu before you get finished," said Mr. Pritchard, the
ship's owner. "We have to catch the tide, if we're to get out of
harbour safely."
<P>    Smooth flavour ... What the hell! He jumped out of his seat
and glared at Pritchard. It finally got through to him that the
banks of the Columbia River were moving past the windows of the
ship's cabin. Their dinner invitation was turning into an
extended voyage. The lady sitting opposite him went into a
convenient choking fit to cover up his confusion.
<P>    "I've got to admit," said his host when things had settled
down, "that I'm really surprised at how young you are. How did
you ever survive such adventures? And as if that wasn't enough,
you brought your lovely wife through the most hostile country in
America. ... Please excuse me for being so curious."
<P>    The lady was trying to look innocent behind a familiar
scarlet-embroidered handkerchief. She winked and he knew he'd
left youth far behind. She was the one who'd tricked him into
coming on board this ship. He stared at her and wondered what
her reasons could be. For a minute he thought he could see the
answer in the way her eyes flashed back at him.
<P>    The contest between him and this beautiful woman had begun
in international rivalry. But that hint of intrigue was only a
reminder of something he'd almost forgotten: the distant
reflection of a hostile face in a punch bowl at a musical
entertainment in Montreal. The face of his once-deadly rival in
love -- now dead and decaying somewhere in the Pembina hills.
<P>    To start with, it was eagerness to fight the enemy and find
adventure. Now he had to face up to the surprising consequences
of those youthful desires.
<P>    She alone knew he was an expendable British officer on a
dubious mission, reporting to an eccentric admiral who was
probably acting beyond his authority. His job was to carry out
clandestine operations on the poorly-defined frontiers of the
U.S.A. and Canada. But to the trappers and traders of the west
coast, he was now the go-ahead rescuer of a U.S. expedition
whose bad luck could be blamed on the British. The way things
were turning out, he was becoming an American hero. And at this
exact moment, he was drinking the very agreeable wine of a
patriotic Yankee ship owner.
<P>    She would never turn him in; he was certain of that. But
what gave him such a gut-feeling of jagged reefs when he looked
into the depths of those grey-green eyes of hers?
<P>    He figured it was best to lie only when he had to. He'd
merely "reinterpret" the facts a little -- from the point of
view of a dead man. It had all started out as a stunt, a confused
night landing on the shores of Lake Ontario near Sackets Harbor.
But for this particular listener, better to skip over the wild
schemes of youth.
<P>    "As a matter of fact, ... we'd just heard the news of the
battle of Waterloo. I was travelling secretly in Canada,
following the trail of a certain sneaky English admiral, Fisher,
by name." He took another sip. Pretty good, really. But it was
time to put on an American accent. Get into the knock-em-down,
drag-em-out spirit of the thing. He slapped his thigh to get
attention and continued in more nasal tones.
<P>    "Well, the war was hardly over and this old buzzard was
already scouting out American defences near British territory. I
can tell you, Mr. Pritchard, just between the three of us, he
was up to no good for the Republic.  And then I had the bad luck
to be put in jail by the military police in Kingston. A bunch of
stuffed shirts -- especially that crusty old artillery officer
who arranged my release. What was his name, anyway, Meadows?
Bush? ... Ah, now I remember. <I>Fielding</I> was the man."
<P>    As the wine began to work, a wave of nostalgia for his own
colourful past swept over him. Here he was, already telling
stories about the "good old days", and only just turned eighteen.

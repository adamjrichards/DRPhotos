<BR>Eric and Enid probably from a different film. Picnic out of Toronto?
<BR>11-03-31: These scans of negative envelopes don't seem as useful as hoped.
Individual pics can be cut out and viewed but quality is too low for
enlargements. They also need reorganization and notes since the negatives are
not always in taking order. Have not hit on an easy way to import the later
scans of individual frames to put allongside the index pics. So the job of
reorganization has to be done twice. Probably less work to simply scan each
individual frame right from the beginning.

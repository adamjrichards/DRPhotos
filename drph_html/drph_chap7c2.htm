<P>    Inside the mud-walled cavern, James Fielding, now incarnated as Wandering
Star, entered the Mandan holy-of-holies. Ranged along the walls of the lodge,
waiting for the climax of the festival, were the young initiates. Skulls,
buffalo and human, were laid out in the centre, witnessing for all their
ancestors the correct re-enactment of tribal origins. Rawhide cords streamed
down in a shaft of light from the smokehole in the roof. Below, on a
scaffolding of sticks, lay the effigy of a tortoise wrapped in colourful
tassels -- the land, humanity's floating home on the broad sea of being. Four
leathern sacks filled with water from the four points of the compass lay at
each side. Grave elders of the tribe guarded these objects and would let no
one approach. As Wandering Star melted into the shadows, the Medicine Man
began his mystic passes before the sacred relics of the Mandan creation. 
<P>    Following the invocation, Wandering Star was led toward the
youths, now composing their minds for the ordeal. He paused in
front of an ochre-painted boy wearing a medicine-bundle on a
cord. The youth stared fixedly at the objects in the centre of
the lodge.  As the two visitors intercepted his vision, his eyes
rose slowly toward the Medicine-man, who nodded toward
Wandering Star and spoke. The words were deliberate but soft,
as if addressed to a child, or to one in a trance. Showing no
recognition, the youth stared at the painted figure of the
star-man.
<P>    Rattles buzzed as priestly assistants kept up a steady chant
and beat upon the four water-filled leather sacks with drum
sticks. The Medicine-man leaned over to speak into the ear of
Wandering Star, but thinking better of it, signified what he
wanted through sign-language. He patted his inner loins and
pointed to the boy, then pretended to pick something up and
cradle it in a mother's arms. Pausing to let this sink in, he
indicated the boy once again. 
<P>    "He's your son!"
<P>    James uttered the words in English, a trifle too loudly as
several heads turned in his direction. But the Medicine-man's
face relaxed; the white man had apparently grasped what was
intended. Catching the hands of the two boys, he pressed them
together. Then with a look of deeper inspiration, he produced a
small knife, plucked out of the air it seemed, and opened a cut
in his son's wrist. These quick gestures had the unreality of a
conjuring trick. Before James could divine the meaning of it,
his own skin had been nicked.  The Medicine-man pressed the
bloodied wrists together and regarded them with coal-like eyes.
Then he grasped Wandering Star's other hand -- which held the
ceremonial axe -- and raised the implement over the Indian boy's
head, but with the blade turned outward.
<P>    "You want me to protect him?"
<P>    Again the Medicine-man's eyes shone. James darted a look
over his shoulder, clearly aware at last that he'd just been
commissioned to stand between the son of a powerful man and some
unknown agency of destruction. He half-expected the menace to
resolve itself into a tangible form and come leaping and baying
out of the shadows, slavering for his throat. 
<P>    A yell went up outside the lodge and the Medicine-man
clutched Wandering Star's shoulder. They left the boy and
hurried back onto the common to observe the population in a
general scramble for the roofs of the lodges. Climbing to a high
lookout, they could see a speck advancing in a zig-zag track
toward the village. Alarm mounted as the speck grew into the
shaggy figure of a demon. Everyone and even the dogs set up a
frightful howl when the apparition entered the gates and charged
through the alleys onto the common where the dancers were
forming up. 
<P>    The black-painted hide of the monster was circled with white
rings; its face was mostly teeth. On its arm, it carried an
eight-foot staff with a kind of bulbous appendage of red cloth
on the end. This it pushed along the ground as it swaggered,
roaring at the women all the while. Between its legs hung a pair
of huge, hairy, buffalo-skin sacks, stuffed to bursting with
straw and dragging on the ground. Strutting to and fro for the
edification of the multitude, this demon hitched up its swinging
manhood and advanced on the crowd waving its red-tipped wand.
Crowds of shrieking women scattered on every side. The Great
Buffalo was back to pay the Mandans a visit.
<P>    Just as this satanic figure was gaining the upper hand, the
leader of the dance emerged from the medicine-lodge, carrying
the Sacred Pipe brought to the village by Lone Man. This holy
relic produced a startling transformation.  When the pipe was
flirted in front of the demon's nose, it gave a shriek of
dismay, rendered immobile by the powerful medicine of Lone Man.
Tottering out of balance, it collapsed into an undignified
position, sitting cushioned on colossal testicles. Then it and
the leader of the dance engaged in a climactic staring contest,
eyes bulging from their heads as the superior power of the pipe
gradually worked its bewitching effect. 
<P>    When the pipe was withdrawn, the demon jumped up once again
and attempted to back away from its control, bumping into the
nearest of the bull-dancers by accident. Feigning surprise, it
leaped high in the air, brandishing its wand and resuming former
vigour. At last it had discovered the proper target of its lust.
Catching the nearest "cow buffalo", the demon pressed her to
earth and mounted on the raised posterior with ardent roars. The
wand with its glowing red knob was introduced between the cow's
parted legs from behind, to be worked back and forth inside the
dancer's costume and emerge at the neck. The recipient of the
demon's attention clung to the instrument of delight, to the
extent of pretending to chew playfully on the red tip.  By this
time, the crowd's shrieks of terror had been transformed into
hoots of laughter. The "female" of each of the remaining three
pairs of bull-dancers received the same treatment till the
demon's vitality was totally spent. Now the Great Buffalo's job
of impregnation was done and the Mandans had no more use for
him.
<P>    A woman ran out of the crowd and dashed a double handful of
dirt in the monster's face, transforming it from gleaming black
to ochre-gray. She seized its wand, now powerless as an
instrument of procreation, and broke it over her knee. Other
women ran in and shattered the useless tool in even smaller
pieces. The demon was now the target of a general rout, hounded
out of the village by clouds of women and boys, pelted with
every kind of filth.
<P>
<P>    Wandering Star hovered on the fringes of the common. With
the departure of the demon-buffalo, the bystanders fell into a
hush. The bull-dance was now complete; the hunt would be a
success. It was the most propitious time of the whole year. A
moment in eternity when cosmic forces stalked the earth.
<P>
<P>    The Medicine-man beckoned him back to the lodge and he was
admitted again by the warriors guarding the entrance. The
paraphernalia of the Mandan creation had been removed and six of
the youths to be initiated stood below the roof aperture,
waiting among the rawhide cords that hung down ready to take
them heavenward. Wandering Star was pressed forward to stand
behind the circle of solemn-faced young men. He felt their
closeness and smelt an odour of fear and exaltation.  Assistants
to the Medicine-man began their preparations, laying out bundles
of short wooden splints and scalping knives. He wondered if by
some horrible misunderstanding these implements were meant for
<I>him</I>. 
<P>    The first initiate, as suited the position of his father,
was Wandering Star's new-made blood brother. The boy lay down
on the ground, staring upward at the smoke-hole in the roof.
Two pinches of flesh were raised from his breasts and
immediately punctured by the knives of the assistants. Pain
flashed through James' own breast at the sight of the blade
slicing flesh. A spurt of blood and Wandering Star was forgotten
as James Fielding recalled his own experiment with human surgery
on the shore of Lake Superior. That too had been a shocking
initiation.
<P>    The boy made no movement, but continued to smile upward as
skewers of wood were inserted through the incisions in his
breast. Around these were looped the thongs which hung from the
roof aperture. Warriors on the roof immediately began to haul
upward, raising the boy into a semi-upright position. Further
incisions were made in his arms and legs to insert still more
skewers. To these were attached the heavy skulls of buffalo,
weapons and tools. But the boy made no movement to resist.  As
he was dragged off his feet into the high circle of light, the
skin of his breasts rose a good handspan away from his chest.
All through it he continued to smile in perfect benediction at
those below, ascending gradually toward the smoke hole till his
feet were the height of a man's head above the ground.
<P>    Under its concealing grease, James' own face was less calm.
In the cavernous medicine-lodge, yet another aspect of the
fathomless mystery of growing up was darkly revealed. In
sympathy with the boy, he could feel the stretching and tearing
of his own flesh. In the deeper caverns of his mind, he was
again haunted by the dark mysteries of the Christian faith. His
early distaste for religion came back in a flood as he recalled
the words of his mother's favourite preacher, the Reverend
Dinsmore, who dwelt on the joy of being "washed in the blood of
the lamb." Oh indeed, the sacrifice they'd demanded of him was
physically less taxing than the ordeals of the heathen savage.
But in essence, the symbols were equally sanguine. They might
have nailed him on a cross to celebrate his own coming of age,
but as a concession to Protestant decency, he'd be allowed to
crucify <I>himself</I> in the privacy of his own mind.
<P>    Prodded by a warrior manipulating a pole, the suspended
youth began to spin round, facing skyward for deliverance. "My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?" wailed the despairing
words from some hidden recess of darkness. Face transfigured
with pain at last, the boy let out a terrible shriek, his head
falling on his breast. "And Jesus cried out with a loud voice,
and gave up the ghost," came the echo. The rotation slowed and
the boy hung motionless in a pillar of swirling luminescence. In
that final instant, what had spoken? a triumphant spirit, or
tormented flesh?
<P>    The inert form was lowered ground-ward, to all appearances
senseless as a corpse. The Medicine-man pressed Wandering Star
forward and made him understand that he should have the
privilege of releasing the thongs that had suspended the boy.
Seizing the tip of the splint that was embedded in the boy's
right breast, James attempted to withdraw it, but the flesh came
up as if pulled again by the suspending thong. Revulsion flooded
over him and he snatched his hand away. A calmer prompting told
him to press the flesh down with one hand while he pulled on the
splint with the other.  At last he was able to extract both
skewers, but not without the effusion of more blood from the
wounds now unplugged. He was reaching to undo the rest, to
release the weight of skulls and weapons still attached to the
boy's body, when he was firmly stayed by an assistant. These
last burdens must remain.
<P>    Another candidate was now receiving the same treatment.
James concentrated his attention on the Medicine-man's son to
the exclusion of all else.  For ten minutes the boy sprawled
lifeless on the floor of the lodge. At length he stirred and
tried to get up, dragging with him that awful baggage of skulls
and implements still attached to his flesh. 
<P>    On one side, sat an old man with a buffalo skull in front of
him. The judge in the arrow-shooting contest! James followed as
his charge crawled toward this ancient warder of the faith. The
boy kneeled and placed his left hand on the top of the skull,
fingers extended. With a hollow clop, the axe fell, neatly
severing the outer finger close to the hand. Discarded forever,
it remained daintily in place on the top of the skull. The old
man deftly brushed it off and raised his hatchet to deal with
the next digit that should be offered for his pious
ministration. 
<P>    Black outrage grew in James' breast at the effrontery of it.
What perverted belief could require the casual donation of a
finger to mere sectarian whim? As he followed the stumbling
initiate to the entrance of the lodge, he expanded his rage to
every stupid sacrifice imposed by religious, civil and military
authority. The list of absurdities burgeoned in his mind, from
fingers to foreskins, from bowing and scraping before periwigged
idiots, to "dying for one's King and Country." 
<P>    Contemplating the vastness of the catalogue, his outrage was
finally overwhelmed by injustice. An infinity of grotesque
imposition choked the world. Losing the outer finger of the left
hand was not, after all, the most terrible sacrifice he could
imagine.  But the thing still angered and sickened him. How
could he feel kinship to a blood-brother who embraced needless
pain so willingly? 
<P>    One last horror waited at the door of the medicine-lodge.
Strong-limbed warriors, themselves bearing the marks of previous
initiations, seized the boy and bound leather thongs to his
wrists. With these they raised him to a standing position and
trotted him round the common to the joy of the railing
multitude. In private despair, James watched this travesty of a
footrace. Never had he felt more excluded from the roaring
unanimity of his fellow human-kind. As the two warriors
quickened the pace, the dangling skulls jounced against the
ground, jerking at the boy's wounded flesh. The weight of one
burst loose its anchoring flap of skin and skittered to the side
of the track, empty eye-sockets gazing upward as the fainting
youth was dragged round on the second lap.  At last the boy fell
to his knees and was dragged at full length in the dust.
Enthusiastic spectators joined in the <I>melee</I>, attempting to
pounce on the trailing skulls and detach them from his flesh by
main force. 
<P>    He was finally deposited at the side of the track, bleeding
and unconscious. A few skewers, with their buffalo skulls firmly
attached, remained embedded. Public attention now shifted to the
next initiate in the continuing race around the common. James
felt a strong impulse to steal forward and put an end to the
torment. Then he remembered the staying hand of the
Medicine-man's assistant within the lodge. It appeared that what
was publicly sanctioned must run its course. As Wandering Star
and a warrior in his own right, he'd have to maintain the stoic
indifference of the calling, refrain from displaying any signs
of an effete tenderness.
<P>    He stood watching the silent form. Apparently, the boy had
been a completely willing participant. What was the meaning of
an ordeal accepted with such abandon? His own father possessed a
book filled with the strange formulas of a mystic cult. It
contained one illustration that hung in his mind: an empty cross
entwined with a briar rose. Saving joy amidst killing thorns.
But the Mandans wrote no books of occult metaphysics that he
might consult. He found himself wishing he better understood
their language. Truly, no one could make sense of the Okipa from
outward appearance alone.
<P>    These ruminations ended abruptly when he spied someone
lingering in an alley between the lodges, regarding them darkly
from a safe distance. He turned to his charge. The boy had
regained a little vitality and was stirring in the dust against
the weight of his burdens. Struggling to his hands and knees, he
began to crawl along a route leading out of the village.
Together with a few curious bystanders, James followed at a
discreet distance, unable to fathom the goal of this pathetic
traveller or why no Samaritan intervened.
<P>    The boy passed through the gate onto the prairie where he
continued to crawl toward the long grass. James was about to
follow when the thought struck him that it was all too obvious.
He would be seen leaving with the Medicine-man's son. The
general assumption that Wandering Star had interfered and
released the boy from his bonds might have unfortunate
consequences. 
<P>    While the youth was disappearing into the grass, James
pondered what to do next. He must discharge his responsibility
to shield the boy from harm. But what, exactly, was the threat?
Surveying the few onlookers, he was now quite sure the same
person -- the one he'd seen watching at the conclusion of the
race -- had followed them to the village gate. The nameless
threat was growing more tangible by the minute. 
<P>    The ever-reliable flanking manoeuvre took him back toward
the medicine-lodge, disarming the curiosity of the bystanders.
As Wandering Star, he slipped easily through the crowd who were
intent on the plight of the last initiates being raced around
the common, fainting under their loads of skulls. All eyes were
on the youths, including those of the scandalized Captain Ames,
now emerging wide-eyed from a peek into the Medicine-lodge,
fanning himself with a turkey wing and decrying savage morals in
a loud voice.
<P>    Dodging through back alleys, James evaded the pursuing
Indian and was soon out the opposite gate where he made his way
down the bank of the Missouri. He passed by the village
sweat-lodge, but no one was taking the vapours on this high
festival day and he was unobserved. Keeping out of sight of the
palisade, he decided to climb the river bank further upstream
and circle round to the back of the village.

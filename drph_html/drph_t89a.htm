<I>0527-02 </I> - <B>Kensington Gardens, boating on The Serpentine.</B><xxx>

<BR>    After finding a hotel in the Bayswater Road area, we set off
on a walk through nearby Kensington Gardens. In the middle of
London, you can go boating on the Serpentine, the artificial
lake that divides Kensington Gardens and Hyde Park. English
daisies spangle the grass. Back home the dandelions must be out.

<I>0527-03 89</I> - <B>Kensington Gdns, Merle walking on Rotten Row.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Heading for Buckingham Palace, we stroll down Rotten Row
with a bridle path alongside. Merle recalls a scene from some
Regency romance novel. We saw a few riders taking the air, but
no fashionable ladies and gentlemen. Early in May, the sycamore
trees are still in bud.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-05.jpeg">
<I>0527-05 </I> - <B>Equestrian statue of Wellington, near Apsley House.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Continuing on toward the heart of London, we pass Apsley
House, containing the Wellington Museum, and pause for a brief
look at the Great Man's statue.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0339/0339-36.jpeg">
<I>0339-36 </I> - <B>Achilles, near Apsley House?</B><xxx>

<BR>    The inscription reads: To Arthur, Duke of Wellington, and
his brave companions in arms, this statue of Achilles, cast from
cannon taken in the victories of Salamanca, Vittoria, Toulouse
and Waterloo, is inscribed by their countrywomen.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-01.jpeg">
<I>0340-01 </I> - <B>Green Park.</B><xxx>

<BR>    In Green Park, the leaves are a bit more advanced on the
Sycamores. (Actually, this picture was taken later in the
month.)
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-08.jpeg">
<I>0527-08 </I> - <B>Palace gate.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We arrive at Buckingham Palace.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-09.jpeg">
<I>0527-09 </I> - <B>Palace front yard.</B><xxx>

<BR>    And peer through the fence. To see the Changing of the Guard
you have to get to the Palace by 11:30, or earlier if you expect
to find a good position.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-13.jpeg">
<I>0340-13 </I> - <B>Tourist standing on head, waiting.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !What to do while standing around waiting for something to
happen. How about yoga excercises on the grass? !Something for
the Kilroy book of records. Samantha Kilroy of Scarborough,
Ontario, scoops her entire 1989 High School graduating class.
The Queen was not amused. Wasn't even told about it, in fact.
<BR>

<I>0527-07 </I> - <B>Tulips in Queen's Gdns opp. Palace, growing.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Or, you could simply watch the tulips grow in the Queen's
Gardens opposite the Palace. !Restful, but not very stimulating.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-03.jpeg">
<I>0340-03 </I> - <B>Changing of the guard, entering the palace.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Finally, a marching band comes down the Mall and the new
guard approaches the Palace.     
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-08.jpeg">
<I>0340-08 </I> - <B>Changing of the guard, leaving the palace.</B><xxx>

<BR>    After considerable stamping to and fro inside the gates --
which you can't see very well because you lost your position
beside the fence -- the old guard and their escorts march out
again. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-07.jpeg">
<I>0340-07 </I> - <B>Changing of the guard, band, opp Canada gate.</B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-11.jpeg">
<I>0340-11 </I> - <B>Queen Victoria Memorial.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Queen Victoria seems quite content, especially with the
weather. I first saw this statue in the 1950s. Victorian taste
is not on the agenda here. It's more a matter of meeting a
long-lost friend. !Overdressed, perhaps, but jolly good to see
the old girl again. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0340/0340-12.jpeg">
<I>0340-12 </I> - <B>Vict. Mem., detail.</B><xxx>

<BR>    This is not the British Statue of Liberty. That torch may
imply the spread of peace, order and good government, but the
lion distinctly says, "Don't tread on my tail."
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-11.jpeg">
<I>0527-11 </I> - <B>Queen Victoria Memorial, detail, looking up the Mall.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !Looking up the Mall from the steps of Victoria's Memorial.
We'll walk on the left side of the street.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-12.jpeg">
<I>0527-12 </I> - <B>Marlborough House.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Here my notes are unclear. Identified this at first as
Clarence House, the home of the Queen Mother. Looking through an
old travel book from 1889 revealed it to be Marlborough House.
In those days, it had chimneys on the roof, just above the oval
medallions on the top floor. Show you the picture, if you like.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-13.jpeg">
<I>0527-13 </I> - <B>Nelson's Col., Traf Sq.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We reach Trafalgar Square with St. Martin-in-the-Fields
behind it. The "fields" have long since been paved over.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-14.jpeg">
<I>0527-14 </I> - <B>Fountain of Eros, illuminated signs.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !On to Picadilly Circus and the Fountain of Eros. The wingy
brat has just pierced Merle with one of his erogenous shafts.
Now I'm not sure if she's ga-ga at me, London in general, or
just anxious to get somewhere for dinner.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-23.jpeg">
<I>0527-23 </I> - <B>Nelson's Col. and bus, next day.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Another day, we resume our tour back at Trafalgar square.
This is morning rush hour. Don't step off the kerb to get a
closer picture or you'll have -- in the words of Flanders and
Swan -- a 97 horsepower, hold very tight please, London
Transport ... omnibus zooming up your zoom lens.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-18.jpeg">
<I>0527-18 </I> - <B>M. as Androcles, Traf. Sq.</B><xxx>

<BR>    This lion at the base of Nelson's Column is one of four
designed by the artist Edwin Landseer. Merle, the Androcles of
the Brock Faculty of Education, pauses to take a thorn out of
His Highness' paw. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-20.jpeg">
<I>0527-20 </I> - <B>"Lager lout" in front of N's col.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !One of Britain's famed "lager louts" waking up from an
all-night vigil at the base of Nelson's Column. Why they prefer
bottled lager beer to a pint of bitter fresh from the tap is
beyond me. Less potable, more portable, one supposes.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-21.jpeg">
<I>0527-21 </I> - <B>Porch of National Gallery.</B><xxx>

1724.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-25.jpeg">
<I>0527-25 </I> - <B>Nelson's Ices, ice cream van.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Lord Nelson would rotate on his column if he could see his
name being used for crass commercial purposes. Cost about one
pound fifty for each of us, if memory serves.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-22.jpeg">
<I>0527-22 </I> - <B>Moore statue outside British Council office.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !A Henry Moore statue outside the British Council offices on
the left. From here we set off down Whitehall.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-26.jpeg">
<I>0527-26 </I> - <B>Whitehall, Life Guard.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !Past the Horse Guards Parade with the Queen's Life Guard on
duty. Actually, I <U>tried</U> to botch this picture in homage to
Paddington Bear who, in a recent children's book, also took a
memorable photo on this very spot.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-28.jpeg">
<I>0527-28 </I> - <B>Whitehall, flags overhead.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We are now strolling down Whitehall with flags overhead.
!Some sort of European Community building, I believe. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-29.jpeg">
<I>0527-29 </I> - <B>Richmond House, the Cenotaph.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !The Cenotaph in front of Richmond House. This is one of the
few places where a piece of recent architecture harmonizes
well with the surrounding older buildings.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-32.jpeg">
<I>0527-32 </I> - <B>Big Ben.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !Big Ben, and just about time for mid mid-afternoon
refreshment. Hang on to your brolly, it's a popular corner and
the sidewalks are thronged with jostling tourists and
school-children.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-34.jpeg">
<I>0527-34 </I> - <B>View down the Thames from Westminster Br.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We edge through the crowds to the parapet of Westminster
Bridge, here looking down-stream. This is Westminster pier. We
begin to get ideas about going on a boat tour.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-37.jpeg">
<I>0527-37 </I> - <B>Boadicea and souvenir sellers.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !A trifle late for today. We turn our attention from the
future back to the past where it belongs. Boadicea is exhorting
the ancient Britons to defend their country against the pushy
Roman Imperialists. Meanwhile, the more sold-out of her subjects
are busy with other things.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-33.jpeg">
<I>0527-33 </I> - <B>Boadicea against the sky.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Rise up and fight for cultural integrity, sluggards. Can't
you see where all this talk about free trade is leading?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0527/0527-38.jpeg">
<I>0527-38 </I> - <B>Westminster pier looking across the Thames.</B><xxx>

<BR>    One morning, we <U>do</U> take the boat from Westminster pier.
That's County Hall in the background, once the home of the famed
London County Council, a municipal government that was probably
second only in power to the British Government itself. Now it's a
victim of creeping Thatcherism.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0529/0529-23.jpeg">

Westminster bridge and head upstream.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0529/0529-26.jpeg">
<I>0529-26 </I> - <B>Battersea Power Station.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !On our left, Battersea Power Station, or what's left of it.
!Now out of commission, gutted, and in the process of being
converted into a commercial and entertainment development.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0529/0529-28.jpeg">
<I>0529-28 </I> - <B>Chelsea Br.?</B><xxx>

<BR>    Chelsea Bridge gets lit up at night. We ourselves ended up
lit up at this very spot after a pub walk one evening. It was
led by a very entertaining American who has lived and worked as
a journalist in London for 17 years.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0529/0529-29.jpeg">
<I>0529-29 </I> - <B>Apartment building, Britain's space effort?</B><xxx>

<BR>    !Richmond, a revelation of Georgian facades. Those who were
not <U>on</U> boats were either <U>watching</U> boats or standing in line
to <U>get onto</U> boats. This is May, not August, remember. Rotten
weather, the locals assured us. Things would soon simmer down
into the old familiar rain and sleet and fog and hail.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0529/0529-35.jpeg">
<I>0529-35 </I> - <B>Richmond, waterfront park.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !Closer view of the Richmond waterfront. !A suburb of
London, really. In the middle of the 18th century, much of this
was bosky farmland. Then the toffs moved in, and things went
down hill, or rather, <U>up</U> hill. It's the namesake of Richmond
Hill, Ontario.

<I>0529-37 </I> - <B>Entrance.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Soon after Richmond, we reach Hampton Court and stand full
of excitement and bubbles at the entrance to the Palace. The
warm colours of the brick and the "domestic" look of Tudor
architecture give it an agreeable homey feel.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0530/0530-03.jpeg">
<I>0530-03 </I> - <B>Dragon and portcullis.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !The Fish Court somewhere deep within. The palace is really a
tightly-built village of adjoining buildings: wings, chambers,

<BR>    !Late afternoon. The gardens give you an impression
complimentary to the Palace itself, of a series of adjoining and

park area has its own mood and the feel of some comfortable
outdoor room where you'd like to spend more time ...

St. !A pilgrimage to see again the things that seemed so

<BR>    The Elgin Marbles are now beautifully housed in this gallery
donated by the art dealer, Lord Duveen. On my first visit, I
recall only the dim interiors of temporary post-war galleries.
The sculptures round the walls come from the frieze that once
encircled the Parthenon.

<BR>    This sloping group of figures was located on the gable end
of the temple, that triangular area above the pillars and under
the edge of the roof. At the left side, the chariot horses
disappear into the sea on a journey to eternity. Uniformed

<I>0530-18 </I> - <B>EM, reclining figure.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Headless, this figure has a potent, elemental quality. We
probably derive ideas from classical art that the original
makers never intended. Try to picture this sculpture with arms,
feet, head and a coat of garish paint. It'd be much harder to
see the artist's mastery of pure form with these distractions.
<BR>

<BR>    Today, we sit quietly in front of monuments like this, doing
philosophical meditations on the nature of civilization, the
convulsive movements of history. It's a little disquieting to
imagine these precincts at festival time, full of the hoopla of
religious enthusiasm, and very little philosophy.
<BR>

<I>0530-21 </I> - <B>Trajan, Roman antiquities.</B><xxx>

<BR>    I first saw this bust in the 50s. And from somewhere else, 
recall a history textbook with a reproduction of it. The Emperor
Trajan stood for the Roman Empire at its height, well organized,
secure, universal. But is that a touch of boredom in those blank
eyes?

<I>0530-22 </I> - <B>Granite figure, Egyptian.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The Egyptians pharaohs were not like we classical Greeks,
Adoni. More than a touch of smug barbarism still sneers down at
us today. Thutmose III was not a humanist. He didn't believe,
like the Greeks, that man was the measure of all things. <U>He</U>,
already, was chief cubit in the land.

<BR>    They were not interested in portraying character or emotion,
in playing games with ideas or politics, in creating art for
art's sake. This cool, unruffled figure represents pure,
monolithic power, handed down from inscrutable gods, who did not
have human faces.

Needle on the Victoria embankment. Fodor's guidebook says it has
nothing to do with Cleopatra, was carved ca 1450 B.C. for
Thutmose III, and presented to Britain by Mohammed Ali in 1819.

<BR>    Due to traffic noise, the Victoria Embankment on the north

travellers said in the past about the huge size of the building,
today you get an impression of it being increasingly jammed-in

sanitised hives for human bees. The people who design them, as

be distracting. The road to hades, they say, is lined with great
statuary. Well, <U>I</U> say.

<I>0341-16 </I> - <B>Perseus slaying Medusa at the base of Trajan's Column.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !A gory finale to our stay in London: looks like Perseus
murdering Medusa at the foot of Trajan's Column. Actually, I'm
told the outrage didn't really happen at the foot of Trajan's
Column, and not in Rome, but in Greece somewhere. And Trajan had
nothing to do with it. But you can imagine the sort of confusion
museums unwittingly create in literal minds by jumbling time and
space together in one room. Never mind <U>literal</U> minds. The
restraint of original context is completely gone. Fantasic new
relationships between incompatible ideas blossom like dandelions
in the spring grass. The mind leaps tall monuments at a single
bound. Isn't tourism wonderful? 
<P>The End.</B>

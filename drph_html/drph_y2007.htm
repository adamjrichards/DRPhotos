<BR><B>JULY 6 Friday.</B>   1230am nearing the Soo.
Camp last night at Batman's Tent and RV
park. Arrive 10pm-ish. Seems to be nobody
home. Flashes of lightning in the
distance. Chatty proprietor eventually
turns up. Fifth wheel trailer in line
ahead of us, also chatty. Adoni discreetly
trying to speed up the process.
<BR>
<BR>Rain in the air. Drizzle as we put up the
tents. Can't figure out how to get the
poles inserted in the dark. I do it the
wrong way several times in a row. Haven't
felt so stupid and frustrated in years.
Miriam  and Adonis eventually have to
show us how. Merle's headlamp a godsend.
Otherwise we'd still be stumbling about
in the dark.
<BR>
<BR>Get the tent pitched, bedding arranged.
Crawl into the sack. Discover we are
on the edge of a ditch and a set of very
deep tire ruts. Put on our underwerar
again, drag the tent sideways. Finally
achieve a decent level of comfort.
<BR>
<BR>Weather calms down. A frog glug, glug,
glugging all night. Loons in the
distance.  Wake several times but
comfortable. My usual coffee and porridge
on the SVEA stove this morning.
<BR>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D204/D204-045.jpeg">
<I>D204-045 08-01-27</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>To Espanola for brekkie. Wonderful place
opp the OPP station. Onward to the Trans
Canada Highway. Buy another headlamp
at the Canadian Tire store in Espanola,
although I trust we'll be more efficient
at tent-pitching tonight.
<BR>
<BR><B>JULY 7 Saturday.</B>   Arrive at Gargantua
Bay 5-6pm last night. Almost a kilometer
of sand. An island at the mouth of the
bay with a small navigation light. Unload
the car at the boat launch parking lot.
Assemble one kayak. Ferry the other
kayak, still packed in its cases, plus
gear down the beach to our selected
campsite. We set up in time for a small
campfire. Mosquitoes ferocious. Slather
in Deet.
<BR>
<BR>Today, up at 7 for the usual dilithium
and porridge. Then off paddling to Warp
Bay in the kayaks. More lovely campsites.
Back against headwinds, a light swell
from the Lake Superior verging on
whitecaps when we turn into Gargantua
Bay.
<BR>
<BR>A lazy aft beachcombing. Oh, saw a wreck
in Gargantua Bay this morning. We paddled
over and round it. Ribs sticking out of
the water and two huge iron cylinders
from the engine.
<BR>
<BR><B>JULY 8 Sunday.</B>   Mixed weather, rain in
the morning. Breakfast, DGF, reading.
<BR>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D204/D204-046.jpeg">
<I>D204-046 08-01-27</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Afternoon, paddle south in off and on
sun. A slight swell coming in from the
lake. Refreshing, invigorating, scary?
The water has a wonderful blue-green
colour. Sandy bottom near our campsite
changing to huge boulders southward. Down
the coast, left of the bay when looking
west, ochre and grey cliffs, fantastically
broken in places. Some places, smoothed
by wave or glacier. Layers, mixed,
twisted. Scenes from a Bartram print.
<BR>
<BR>Get the kayak into one narrow cleft with
not enough room to turn. Have to back out.
One or two "bathtubs" down here. Perfect
for a hot afternoon's skinny. A prime
spot for a picnic lunch away from our
camp on the beach.
<BR>
<BR>Merle and I back to camp via the parking
lot to get stuff out of the car. Miriam
and Adonis go round the small island in
the bay. Practice my over-the-side exit.
Semi-wet-suit pants a partial success. A
real "farmer john" wet-suit, tighter
fitting, would probably be even better.
Ability to jump out into the water gives
a feeling of being master of the
situation. Otherwise every launch and
landing threatens to be ignominious.
Especially when beaching the kayak on a
problematic shore with rocks or waves.
<BR>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D204/D204-047.jpeg">
<I>D204-047 08-01-27</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Haven't decided on our plans for
tomorrow. Tonight is the last night paid
for. Miriam has a sore hand from a fall
on the rocks while walking out to the
northerly point enclosing Gargantua
Harbour.
<BR>
<BR><B>JULY 9 Monday.</B>   We decamp Gargantua
Harbour Beach en route to Warp Bay. We
are now on a shallow sand dune at the
head of the bay. A long view south, back
toward the mouth of Gargantua Harbour.
More shelter here, more interesting
islands in the offing.
<BR>
<BR>We have a late lunch after about an hour
and a half paddle getting here. Some food
and equipment had to go back to the car
before starting out. Now we can't easily
reteat to the car to replenish supples.
We are fully committed.
<BR>
<BR>After lunch, another paddle round toward
Cape Gargantua. Didn't quite make the
whole distance before turning back, but
the route seems inviting. Will try again
tomorrow. On the way back to camp, Merle
and Derek paddle across to Devil's
Warehouse Island, the ocher mine island.
Glide along beneath steep cliffs,
brilliantly coloured by mineral and
lichen deposits, and dropping sheer into
the water.
<BR>

<BR>An elemental quality about certain slabs
of rock can elicit an almost religious
feeling. Almost? Actually! It's like
sudden revelation of some hidden aspect
of Being. Normally it would probably be
difficult to experience something that
was everywhere, that permeated everyday
experience, that was masked by a thousand
other dusty details. But huge rocks,
mountain tops, lakes, river, skies seem
to blow away the dust, at least for a
while.
<BR>
<BR>The ancients sometimes claimed that the
planets moving in their orbits emitted the
musical tones of a celestial harmony.
But we couldn't hear this because it was
always present. The mind filtered it out.
(It doesn't matter that sound waves can't
be transmitted in a vacuum.)
<BR>
<BR>Am now sitting on the sand in one of those
pinch-your-bum, light weight folding camp
chairs. Hardly a chair, it's right on the
ground, but it does give back support.
Hard to get enough of this scene. Easy to
keep gazing and gazing. A fishing boat
hovers down near the mouth of Warp Bay.
Bird songs all around. Every treed island
seems to have its own voices. Miriam is
gathering firewood for this evening.
<BR>
<BR>I think if we were alone I'd try to talk
Merle into taking her clothes off for
some sun, sand and skin pictures.
Probably have to use the old reliable
"artist position" to avoid serious
embarrassment later on. You know, the
Rokeby Venus posture. Emphasize the
tactile qualities without displaying any
chancy bits.

<BR>This is worth another trip. Plan a more
extended but still leisurely route.
Seeing this up close, I'm not sure if the
old inland haunts quite compare? Well,
yes, OSA Lake, for one location certainly
does. But the openness of this scene, the
larger scale is impressive. A narrow
space between two islands, then open
water for a hundred miles or more. 
<BR>
<BR>Con trail of a plane heading south. Had
similar thoughts on the Pukasaw hike, of
being, at last, far away from the rat
race.
<BR>
<BR><B>JULY 10 Tuesday.</B>  Threats of weather on
the marine radio. Decide to make a dash
for Cape Gargantua in the morning.
Cloudy-dull. An easy paddle. We can't see
what's so special about our destination
until the last minute. "The Devils's
Chair" has two holes pierced low in the
back, reminding me of a two-holer
outhouse seat. I'll bet the voyageurs
called this "The Devil's Privy" or some
such. Paddle back against light headwinds
after inspecting the local campsites.
These are secluded but claustrophobic
after Warp Bay.
<BR>
<BR>Turns out after we get back, that Miriam
and Adonis were hallooing at us from the
top of the cliff overlooking "The Devil's
Chair". An inland hiking trail leads to
this point from Warp Bay.

<BR>After lunch all go on a hike to
Chalfant Cove. Three Km on the map but
seems longer. Find a pathetic memorial
cross and a message in a bottle on the
beach. I Open this for a look. Then it
begins to rain. All the way home and into
the early evening with a couple of hours
respite around campfire time. This we
start the hoser way, with gasoline, and
with much huffing and puffing to keep it
going.
<BR>
<BR>Waves pound on the beach all night. Wind
rattles the tent. By now we're fairly
damp around the edges, what with our
soggy walk back from Chalfant Cove, and
miscellaneous small tent leaks. But the
sleeping bags are still warm.
<BR>
<BR><B>July 11 Wednesday.</B>   The weather
gradually tapers off by about 9:30am.
Breakfast while listening to weather
forecasts on the marine radio. Small
craft warnings, but a west or NW wind is
favourable. Time to abandon the outpost.
I stroll dowen the the beach to find our
kayak half buried in sand thrown up by
the waves overnight. Lucky it didn't get
washed away. Miriam and Adonis had the
foresight to move theirs to higher ground
last night.
<BR>
<BR>We pack and leave by noon. Tail winds, a
swell from the lake. Especially big
waves when coming into Gargantua Harbour.
We have the distinction of doing white
water kayaking on Lake Superior.
<BR>
<BR>Am unable to take any pictures on this
leg. Don't dare release my grip on the
paddle even for a few seconds. At one
point we seem to make agonizingly slow
progress getting lined up to enter the
channel between Gargantua Harbour's
island and the north point. The waves
begin hitting us diagonally, but the
prospect of short-cutting through the
wild surf beating against the rocks off
the port beam isn't too inviting either.
Some of these waves are also reflecting
off the rocks and rebounding to create a
chaos of criss-crossing wave crests.
Eventually we make the turn inland and
practically surf shoreward, gaining
momentum and sliding down the inclined
fronts of the waves.
<BR>
<BR>Meanwhile Miriam and Adoni have
disappeared in the confusion, creating a
certain anxiety when we have time to
think about it. On the crests we get a
fine view all around. No sign of them.
Down in the troughs you can't see the
land at all, only the blue-green flanks
of the waves and the sky above.
<BR>
<BR>Emerging into calmer waters behind the
shelter of the island, we spy Miriam and
Adoni on the beach already unloading.
They have paddled on the south side of
the island and were invisible to us from
the north side. We take a couple of big
ones over the side while landing. But my
trick of jumping out chest deep to
stablilize the kayak seems to work. Just
don't get wedged in between a loaded
canoe or kayak and the shore while you're
being pounded by surf. Until you
experience it, you probably have no idea
of the titanic weight of a loaded or
partially swamped boat as it is pounded
by breaking waves. Eventually we get
packed up with only minor contusions and
on the road again.
<BR>
<BR>Tonight we're at Hattie Cove, Pukaskwa
National Park, campsite #32. In to
Marathon the do laundry and eat. We have
an awful time following directions to get
to the laundry located on a back street.
To the locals it's in the same building
as the piano store, right in plain sight.

<BR><B>JULY 12 Thursday.</B>   Rain. In to
Marathon again for lunch at a cute deli.
Shopping at Canadian Tire, groceries.
Back at camp, a walk around the point in
back of our campsite. In the rain, lush
with many wild flowers we couldn't
identify, interesting rocks. Have
neglected to bring wildflower
identification books.
<BR>
<BR>Supper. Soup. More walking. Sun back
again. Photos on the beach. Looks a good
sport for kayak launching. Weather radio
promises much good for tomorrow. Hot
showers after supper. Merle says, take
the handicapped stall, more room. Sips of
rye whiskey at dusk. Even the mosquitoes
seem loveable tonight.
<BR>
<BR>Desiderata: Derek wants a warm fuzzy, with
hood. A "hoodie" like kids and Wizard of
Id peasants wear. With long arms so he
doesn't have to wear mits in July. And a
water bottle like Miriam and Adonis have.
Should we use the spray skirt in the
kayak? Don't the Ojibwa have some kind
of Santa Claus myth that Derek can embrace.
<BR>
<BR>We were last in this park in 1981 on the
Nature Canada Pukasaw backpacking trip.
At that time the facilities of the park
were limited to interior camping and
canoeing. Leaving from Heron Bay, we were
dropped off with our guides at
Fisherman's cove, miles to the south of
here, to walk back along the coast. A
wonderful trip. Today we have a chance to
see some of the same coastline from an
offshore point of view.

<BR><B>JULY 13 Oh-oh! Friday the n-teenth.</B>  
Up late, blue sky. Kayak ass'y in the
campground, portage to Horseshoe Bay.
Gorgeous sandy beach with regulation
driftwood. We put in before lunch. A
brief exposure to the outer lake, then we
duck in to Hattie Cove through a narrow
inlet. The park has a picturesque
interpretive centre facing the water.
Hattie Cove is a shallow lake, with
ducks, loons, water lilies. Lunch 
against a log on a sandy beach. Cool but
comfy if you hunker down beneath the
breeze. 12 deg C.
<BR>
<BR>Onward to Pulpwood Harbour. Archipelago of
tiny rocky islands to paddle through and
explore. A yacht is anchored in the
harbour. No odour of fried eggs and ham.
They are probably making out in the main
cabin. We attempt to continue south to
Playter Hbr. A heavy swell on Superior
seems a little too exhilirating, so we
turn back remembering our escapade
re-entering Gargantua Harbour. A frisky
entrance to Horseshoe Bay. But no serious
difficulty landing. We portage back to
camp.
<BR>
<BR>To Marathon for dinner. We are exhausting
the dining opportunities in Marathon.
Next step will be to knock at the doors
of private houses and solicit dinner
invitations, or maybe to congregate at
the Can. Tire gourmet food counter for
beef jerky and granola bars. This is the
tail-gate pemmican of latter day
voyageurts. Early to bed. Rain begins
again at 9pm. Eli, eli ...
<BR>
<BR>More desiderata: a wind shield for the stove,
platypus water bottle. New tent, the
zipper on our Eureka has finally jammed
for good, forcing us the gain entry with
a sharp knife. We also need a pocket
communicator CB unit that actually works
for outgoing messages. One of ours can't
talk to the other one.

<BR><B>JULY 14 Saturday.</B>   Rains and rains and
never stops/ Forty days and spoils the
crops.
<BR>
<BR>We hike to the White River suspension
bridge. 3hrs 10mins. A very damp trail
through Lake Superior rain forest. Sunny
spells. No rain but we brush against wet
leaves. The river seems high. A wild
white-water chute seethes beneath the
bridge and is visible below our boots
through protective wire mesh.
<BR>
<BR>The bridge is a real thrill. Probably
worth the three hours hard slogging to get
there. The campsite of yesteryear is still
several km further upstream. 2hrs 50mins
back to our present-day campsite.
<BR>
<BR>Our camp in 1981 was a km or so above the
bridge, and round the turn in the river
that we can see in the distance. But even
in that rocky area we had a sandy beach to
tent on.
<BR>
<BR>Tired this evening. Stewy concoction for
supper. Kayaking prospects on the marine
radio for tomorrow seem mediocre.

<BR><B>JULY 15 Sun-day (a bit).</B>  Risque d'orages
apres midi. Love-sick crows fornicating
in the tree tops. *
<BR>
<BR>We've been making a lot of clever remarks
in the last few days. does anybody
remember even one of them? I know I said
at least 3 smart things recently.
<BR>
<BR>Portaged the few hundred feet from our
campsite to the beach. Got launched from
Horseshoe Bay. Miriam fell in, unfazed.
Launching and landing, it seems, are the
most hazardous parts of kayaking. 
<BR>
<BR>Apart from a modest and glassy swell,
calm conditions. Paddling north, see a
bald eagle on a crag. Nattered at by
gulls, we are not offended. It is such a
lovely morning, we love them. We love
everything. Back across the bay, more
gentle swells. Lovelier still. Water
smooth. Amost no wind. Halcyon weather.
The halcyon was a bird that the ancients
thought nested right on the wine-dark sea
and never needed to come to land. For a
while we feel like this too. 
<BR>
<BR>Today we make our farthest northing on
Lake Superior. On a par with the intrepid
Norwesters. Heron Bay, Marathon and Fort
William are somewhere up ahead in the
blue distance. Sheltering now to write
this in a group of tiny islands opposite
Hattie Cove. Still 1.5 hours left before
the orages that were predicted on the
marine radio. What to do with the idle
time?
<BR>
<BR>Finished Mary Wesley: Part of the
Furniture, yesterday. A favourite book of
the last months. The plot comes full
circle in a most satisfying way.
<BR>
<BR>* We later find that the peculiar noises
of this morning were made by a young crow
as it was fed. But to me this sounded
like the throes of corvid lust. Tanya
Moldauer accuses Richard Peters, my
literary alias, of being guilty as usual
of the pitiful fallacy. That's
"pathetic", Tanya, not pitiful, I-<B>he</B>
says.

<BR>See two bears at the side of the road on
the way to Marathon for a dinner of
Chinese food. Not invited.
<BR>
<BR><B>JULY 16 Monday.</B>   Decamp by 10am and
head south. Check out Horsehoe Bay beach
just before leaving. Weather perfect for
more paddling. Same guy sitting on the
beach doing nothing just like yesterday.
<BR>
<BR>Wawa Goose next. One of the seven
wonders. Better than the Great Pyramid of
Gizeh. (Say, if I built a pyramid in the
front yard, would the neighbours call it
The Great Pyramid of Geezer?)
<BR>
<BR>Stop at the Petroglyphs Prov. Park. Run
out of camera card memory. Need more
memory, less weather. We note in passing
that Agawa Bay park has 2-3km sandy
beach. Inviting. But close to the road.
Must check the web for a map to see if
some of the campsites may be deeper
within the park and more insulated from
road noise.

<BR>The spikey-backked critter in the
pictograms is Misshepezhieu, the Great
Lynx of Ojibwe legend. Have also heard it
described as a dragon or water spirit.
Sometimes playful and protextive,
sometimes dangerous. Don't we know it.
<BR>
<BR>The petroglyph viewing area is staffed
by a park interpreter. She has a kind of
fishpole handy to pull people out of the
water in case they slip off the rocky
shelf. I had to go in bare feet to get
any decent footing. An iron railing has
been removed in the interests of
authenticity. She swears that nobody has
fallen in on her watch.
<BR>
<BR>Back to the car again, thoughts lurn to
logistical details of the trip. Still
haven't solved the problem of how to
store small doo-dads in the rucksack.
It's really more adapted to larger
packages. Still need a compartmentalized
sack or shoulder bag, perhaps detachable
or insertable to contain the Deet bottle,
pocket knife, batteries, memory cards,
aspirin, etc.
<BR>
<BR>Over the border at the Soo to the
Thunderbird Motel in Ignace Michigan. Two
people for US$55. Fish dinner on the
waterfront. Lake trout with whitefish
liver for a side dish. The town is a kind
of touristy amalgam of NOTL and
Tobermory. A convenient marina. The
waterfront stip is full of motels,
eateries, bars, antique galleries, sweet
shops, plus a few regular stores.
<BR>
<BR>Looks like we'll be driving steadily
through Port Huron, Sarnia and home
tomorrow. The land here seems very flat
after the north of Superior. Going to be
an anti-climactic drive. The old
fin-de-siecle feeling is setting in.
Whither, whence, wherefore?

<BR><B>JULY 17 Tuesday.</B>  Bed springy. DNR this
am, but too brief. Hot in the motel room
last night. Try using the air
conditioning, but sounds like a Boeing
747 taking off. Open the door briefly to
let in Ignace, Michigan atmosphere.
Back to sleep eventually. Pasty for
brekkie in the car, then south on I-75. A
pastoral highway, landscape-y but
snooze-inducing.
<BR>
<BR>Across the Mackinac Bridge. Spectacular
views into Lake Michigan. This point is
accessible from Lake Erie without
lockage. A repro of Fort
Michilimackinacinac is visible below the
bridge on the south-western side. Was
this fort held by the British for a time
during the war?
<BR>
<BR>4pm. Visit Diana at Starbuck's in Sarnia.
A quiet moment in her accounting cycle.
She is wearing high heels that make her
look hugely long-legged. They all
discuss corporate stuff: LanXess and
Brock University HR practices or
malpractices. I began to drift off
northward back to our last idyllic paddle
out of Horsehoe Bay at Pukaskwa Park. To
the place where that halcyon bird nests
upon the waters. (And the deer and the antelope play...)
<BR>
<BR>Off again on hwy 402. We should reach
Welland and Farr Rd Farm before 9pm.

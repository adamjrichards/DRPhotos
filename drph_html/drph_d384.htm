<BR> * What, no Art Therapists?
<BR> * That "lamp in the window at dusk feeling."
<BR> * Since, spread around the garden.  Photograph and then pitch? A
new downsizing tool?
<BR> * Babysitting the gallery.

<I>D384-025 16-07-02</I> - <B>Avondale ice cream.</B>

 A treat known only to Niagara residents.
<BR> * A forensic-Sherlockian examination of this picture suggests
that Adam has driven us here.
<BR> * Elementary, my dears. Oh-oh! Needs a touch of the lawn edging
tool, DR.
<BR> * You'll have to take my word on the sound effects.
<BR> * Have taken to leaving NGs outdoors around the propity. Handy
reading matter for an outdoor sit-down. They can't be offloaded
to anyone else. They're only recyclable nowadays as scrap
paper. Or suitable for garden furnishings and picturesque (sic)
stepping stones.

 In this light, seems like a place where Count von Dracula
might have stayed.  
<BR> * DR is here to drive Merle home in case the eye-drops cause
pupil (professor?) dilation.
<BR> * A walk and a shower. Coming down on the left.
<BR> * that merited such a fecal curse? Or was his name simply "Ashton"?
<BR> * River ice coming up over the trail?
<BR> * Pathways may also lend themselves to insertion of figures.
Suggest route, direction, projects, anticipation.
<BR> * Figure ascending?
<BR> * Like the berrybushes on the path toward Mt Robson. A moose
did break out of the bushes and dart across our path.
<BR> * Nice in the garden.
<BR> * Forgotten culvert.

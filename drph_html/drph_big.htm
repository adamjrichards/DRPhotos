<BR>BIG projects: Panavue panoramas, PhotoShop layers
---------------------------------------------------
<BR>Pan of 15,14
<BR>This has layer masks for the fore and middle ground ridgelines.
<BR>Saved from 1213-15.psd above.
<BR>original is 1214-17a1.psd, saved as 1214-17b, but reduced size to 6meg.
18meg .bmp, original size, hangs Ms Word.
<BR>contains: 14e+15p
<BR>Still needs: left shadows improved, scan artifact bottom right,
left sky too dark, smooth sky tones along top. Note: discrepancy
between screen gamma and printer. Printed version with banner
settings, intensity+1, gives excellent gamma values on printout,
but appears light on Samsung 955df monitor. Do not adjust
1215-14q gamma at present for fear of messing up the printout.
In future, should achieve better correlation between proofs on
HP Premium Inkjet Paper and banner paper or other glossy
settings. eg. printer lighten+3 as in HP Premium Photo Paper.
<BR>Edit this file, then save as "r" version below for printing.
<BR>This version specially set up for printing.
rotate "q" 180 deg, 1 pixel black border, 264 white space on
left, 40 white on the bottom. This allows max size printing in
Panavue image assembler.The bottom edge of the image comes out
the right hand side of the printer. The paper must be tight to
this side with a big enough margin for mounting. The top edge
(bottom of the image) with no white space allowance will be
tight against the A3 paper margin. A3 is 297mm wide. But since
we are using 13" roll paper, 330mm, this will leave about 1 inch
extra space on the left, which is actually the bottom of the
original image. This can't be helped with existing software, but
is probably useful for attaching or writing-in captions.

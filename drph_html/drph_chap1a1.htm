<BR clear='all'><P> 
<BR clear='all'><P>   Under a brilliant night sky, the two young men finally left
the last patch of forest behind and turned north-west toward the
southern fringes of Sackets Harbor village. They moved
carefully, picking their way among thousands of tree stumps
littering the weedy fields on either hand. At the top of an
incline near the shore, the leader stopped in his tracks and
waved his companion to a halt. Silhouetted walls loomed over the
coastal plain to the east.
<BR clear='all'><P>   James Fielding, the instigator of this unlikely venture, was
face to face with the dragon at last. A thrill of recognition
shook him: all the maps, sketches and loose talk seemed to drop
into place and chase away the uncertainties of their earlier
bushwhacking. Far behind in a secluded creek mouth, lay a small
sailboat, offering, even now, retreat and second thoughts.
Farther back still, Kingston, the British fortifications, home.
In front of him, the American fort and a complex of dockyard
storehouses, surrounded by menacing redoubts and earthworks,
hoarding secrets. His knees shook, but he led the way forward.
His brother Paul clambered up on a stump to get a better view.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "You keen on dying young?" He grabbed the younger boy by the
arm and hauled him down. "For God's sake, keep below the top of
the rise. Someone might see us against the sky. You could get a
Yankee rifle-ball right through your head." He cleared his
throat, trying to make his voice less shrill.
<BR clear='all'><P>   Now at the edge of the main fort's field of fire, they
paused to make a quick appraisal of its defences. Outer ramps of
earth and a ditch with earth-buttressed palisades protected a
blockhouse. They climbed the outer works and squatted in the
mosquito-filled shadows, peering over the ditch at the walls for
signs of life, speculating in whispers about the best point to
mount a sneak attack. Reaching into a saddle bag, Paul fetched
out pieces of dusty bread and cheese and twisted them in half.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "'Scuse the dirty hands," he ventured, concentrating on
lunch, his mind momentarily off the subject of enemy marksmen
and getting lost. But James was scanning the fortifications like
a general and took the nourishment without noticing its filthy
garnish. 
<BR clear='all'><P>   "We'll go in right there. See that weak spot in the wall?
We'll wade across the ditch, climb up the embankment, hook onto
the top with the grapnel, then drop down the other side. There's
bound to be a footway on the back. The defenders would stand up
there and shoot at anyone coming across the ditch."
<BR clear='all'><P>   "And I'll get my new boots wet," groaned his companion as he
discovered a fresh topic for pessimism. "Mum will have a fit."
<BR clear='all'><P>   "<I>I</I> worry about hostile gunfire and <I>you</I> fuss about wet
feet?" James' heroic challenge to Kingston's wartime nemesis was
not to be fretted away by complaints from the lower ranks about
damp shoeleather.
<BR clear='all'><P>   He had to anticipate every possibility. To face the horrible
responsibility of sending men to their deaths on futile
reconnaisance missions. He imagined himself in the future,
discharging his duty with care and thoroughness. But as one who
would, shall we say, sidestep rash confrontation in favour of a
flanking approach. Much as they were doing right now. Much like
his father. An efficient officer should always take the time to
obtain precise intelligence about the threats he and his men
faced.
<BR clear='all'><P>   But what or who exactly was that threat?  "They are," the
schoolmaster had warned him, "a nation who parades an ignorant
and prickly assertivness. Who war against any sort of polish,
education and order of merit. And you, Master Fielding, had
better take care lest you become one of them." But it was hard
to see that mere bad manners had spawned the red-eyed fury that
devastated the Niagara frontier. An irrational, destructive
power which lurked, perhaps, in this very stronghold.
<BR clear='all'><P>   They slogged across the ditch and scrambled up the opposite
bank. The earth that buttressed the wall was deeply eroded. At
first they succeeded only in pulling saplings and loose turfs
down on top of themselves. On the second throw, the grapnel held
firm and they swarmed up, clinging to the rope and walking up
the wall like insects. At the top they lay on the footway
listening to their hearts pound. James craned his neck to see
inside the fort.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "You know something, I wonder they haven't called out the
guard what with all the noise we've been making. The Yankees
must be getting slack."
<BR clear='all'><P>   A reckless confidence that their enterprise was succeeding
made him want to exaggerate the danger. Then a burst of maniacal
laughter in the distance made them both duck low again. When the
shouting died down, James pretended coolness under fire.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "Oh, Paul, it's only some drunken militiaman over in town."
His excitement rebounded. "Sounds like they're all too far gone
to do <I>us</I> any harm. Come on, let's climb down inside."
<BR clear='all'><P>   They inched along the footway and down a decaying stair to
the inner courtyard of the fort. Their two shadowy figures
darted across the moonlit open space and paused by the main
blockhouse. Backs pressed against the wall, they worked round to
the entrance. They'd have to hurry, signs of dawn were already
brightening the eastern sky.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "Hey, it's padlocked." Paul's voice rose to a squeak. Sure
enough, the door was secured by a large brass lock bearing the
official inscription, "US", plus eagle grasping thunderbolts.
"Looks like we've come all this way for nothing. The place is
abandoned."
<BR clear='all'><P>   Combatting the impending anti-climax, James quickly turned
the face of the padlock toward the moon and noted fresh clues.
"Wait, it's been opened recently, see? -- scratches round the
keyhole. That means somebody's still making regular inspections.
Must be lots of valuable stuff inside."
<BR clear='all'><P>   "But the soldiers have all gone ... unless their sergeant
locks them in at night." 
<BR clear='all'><P>   He was about to quell Paul's <I>naivete</I> with a sharp word,
when a subversive doubt began to take over his own imagination.
The abandoned air of the place chilled him. What could he hope
to accomplish now, other than confronting his own childhood
fears about the Yankee menace. How could he show the schoolyard
bullies a thing or two about the pluck and determination of the
Fieldings if there was nothing here to combat but shadows? He
felt on the verge of turning tail and running when the awful
question hit him again. Had his father <I>really</I> surrendered like a
coward at the battle of Plattsburgh? His mind fled back with a
shudder of horror to weigh the more manageable threats of his
own here and now.
<BR clear='all'><P>   His scheme was on the verge of collapse. Worst of all, he'd
brought a witness along. Paul would blab the details of this
futile errand to all the young bucks of Kingston. Retreat was
impossible. So press on, better to be thought a larcenous knave
than a timid fool.
<BR clear='all'><P>   While Paul kept watch, James stepped out into the moonlight
and surveyed the building with what he hoped looked like calm
self-possession. They could now break in and plunder freely
while the fort was deserted.  But that initial flush of bravado
had gone, and with it the sense of cutting through Gordian knots
with the strong right arm of outraged justice. Now they were
merely prowlers. Or worse still, looters, acting out of far less
admirable emotions. What had become of the fascinating enigma he
had wanted to investigate? The paradox of those renegade,
frontier Englishmen who now thought of themselves as uniquely
American. What of his own plan to strike a blow for the Fielding
honour? Here was only silence, decay and the left-over trappings
of power.
<BR clear='all'><P>   Above his head a line of loopholes pierced the wall of the
upper storey. And square holes for larger weapons. Cannon to be
used as a last-ditch defense, to sweep the inner courtyard with
grape if the outer walls were captured. Would he be able to
charge that yawning gap in the heat of battle?
<BR clear='all'><P>   He swung the grappling iron and snagged the edge of the
building's shingled roof above a cannon port.  The overhang of
the upper storey made it impossible to get a grip on the wall
with his feet.  By hauling himself straight up the rope, he
managed to hook a leg over the sill and straddle the narrow
opening. Squirming through, he found himself in an echoing gun
room under a maze of low beams. It was empty, so far as he could
tell in the dim light. He leaned out to give his companion a
hand.
<BR clear='all'><P>   A stairway led to the lower level. The door at the bottom
resisted with a screech of dry hinges. Going through it, their
backs were now exposed to a dark cavern, as they spent anxious
moments fumbling on the bottom step with flint and steel. Then a
flickering candlelight relieved the gloom. But instead of
row-on-row of soldiers' bunks and racks of gleaming weapons,
they found only stacks of dusty casks, chests and assorted
travelling trunks. The ceiling of this lower storeroom had
leaked down from the gun room above. Everything showed signs of
damage by decay, poor stowage and rats.
<BR clear='all'><P>   Holding aloft the candle, James strolled down the aisles,
picking at open boxes and pitching things down again in
disappointment. It was amazing the prosaic items an army
acquired in the course of a few seasons' campaigning. Lanterns,
kettles, iron-mongery, cordage, medicines -- all of it growing
useless through mould and rust.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "Pity we couldn't find a few Kentucky rifles to liberate. Do
Jonathan a favour, our taking some of this junk off their hands."
A new sensation was coming over him: something he wasn't sure he
liked. The rare test of bravery was merging into a commonplace
test of morals. Thou shalt not steal, said a voice in his ear.
It sounded like the Rev. Dinsmore, the his mother's favourite
preacher.
<BR clear='all'><P>   In a cubicle built into a corner, they found a writing desk
and chair, orphan pieces of skilled joinery among the rough-hewn
boxwood. These were somewhat the worse for wear in the damp
atmosphere of the blockhouse. A clutter of discarded papers
littered the floorboards and a few pages protruded from behind
the warped lid of the desk. On a side table sat a half-empty
bottle of liquor and a sticky glass.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "Looks like someone had a little unfinished business." James
plucked idly at a sheet that stuck out of the desk.  "'To
Colonel Chauncey Enright,' it says.  Lordy! This one's from the
Secretary of War's office." He began to read aloud to Paul,
their pupils growing wider in the dim candlelight.
<BR clear='all'><P> 
          <BR clear='all'><P> Colonel:
          <BR clear='all'><P>   We have noted your concern over the spoilage of stores
          and the diminished state of readiness at Sackets Harbor.
          While I heartily agree with the sentiments you have
          expressed regarding the need for continued vigilance on the
          northern frontier, the War Department cannot at this time
          approve your request for the budget appropriations that
          would make it possible to engage contractors in any
          significant repair work.
          <BR clear='all'><P>   In fact, since the Congress will not authorize the
          maintenance of even current levels of reduced expense,
          manpower must be cut back to a small nucleus of professional
          officers and men.
          <BR clear='all'><P>   However, if you are still intent on pursuing a career as
          a regular officer, we are prepared to discuss an unusual
          survey assignment in the Northwest beyond the military
          district of the Missouri.
          
          <BR clear='all'><P>                                           Yours, etc.
          <BR clear='all'><P>                                         Wilbert Philpott
          <BR clear='all'><P>                                   (Assistant to the Secretary)

<BR clear='all'><P>   The signature was discoloured by a circular stain. As if a
damp liquor bottle had been carelessly, or perhaps <I>angrily</I>,
put down.
<BR clear='all'><P>   Zest for discovery returning, James used his knife to force
open the desk. Inside, he found a prize collection of letters,
charts, drawings and plans of fortifications. Seizing a map
embellished with ornate calligraphy, he cried out in triumph.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "At last! the very thing we came here for. This must be the
original plan of the fort."
<BR clear='all'><P>   "I'm glad you've finally figured out why we're here,"
murmured his companion.
<BR clear='all'><P>   James pored over the map and let the insubordinate remark
pass. Perhaps he really was cut out to be a staff rather than a
knock-about line officer. He noted with intense interest a
wealth of features the original planner must have imagined would
make the fort nearly impregnable. Tunnels for the defenders to
reach remote outworks, a hot shot furnace to heat cannon balls
till they were glowing red and capable of setting fire to
men-of-war entering harbour. The margins were filled with
copperplate handwriting, giving notes on dimensions, bills of
materials, angles of elevation for various ranges and sizes of
gun. The handwriting seemed oddly familiar. And the elaborate
design bore no resemblance to this crude blockhouse and log
palisade.
<BR clear='all'><P>   His enthusiasm flooded back. Here was a completely new
squint on the motives that had drawn him to Sackets Harbor in
the first place. The Honour of the Fieldings was temporarily set
aside. Nascent professionalism now reared its head. The relevant
thing was obviously military intelligence, not contemptible
trophies. Much more important than some hollow sense of triumph.
Even though the enemy was quiescent at the moment, he was, by
the same token, free to plot devilish new schemes. Facts! James
would return home with satchels-full. Strengths, deployments,
battle plans. Vindication through information.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "We <I>must</I> have this map, and this letter, and this, and
this," he gloated.  They began to loot the desk of anything that
looked military or political, leaving behind only the most
boring storekeepers' statements and dunning letters from local
merchants. While they were intent, a key clattered in the lock
of the outer door. In the panic, they upset the candle among the
remaining papers.

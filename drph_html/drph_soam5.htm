<BR clear='all'><P><B>June 18 Day 1.</B>

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-177</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-177.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

The clouds are cooperating with the photographers in the group. The plants
along the way a beginning to look more and more desert-like.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-178</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-178.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Spanish moss, beardy. Derek approves.</B>

Here's a kind of plant that Derek sympathises with. He refuses to think that
the tree is bearded just because it's an old codger of a tree. This is probably
some kind of moss that flourishes in wetter weather and dries up in the off
season.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-179</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-179.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Mt. Veronica maintains surveillance.</B>

We're truly launched. The trail is a beaten dirt path, typical of this
section, clearly marked, no ambiguity at all. We see those snow clad peaks
and wonder if we'll ever again be able to climb that high.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-180</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-180.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Former cochineal bug.</B>

Angelo stops at a large cactus plant, picks off a bit of white fluff. He
mashes it against his palm producing this brilliant red smear. It's the
cochineal bug that used to be harvested for dye. Still has limited use in the
cosmetics industry.
<BR clear='all'><P> BBC article below.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Cochinal bugs on cactus.</B>

The bug grows on a kind of prickly pear cactus. It feeds on the cactus but
doesn't seem to harm it. I don't think I'd like to collect cochineal for a
living, what with those fearsome spines to stick into your fingers.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-182</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-182.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Inca trail refreshment stand.</B>

Small villages line the trail. Local women sell drinks and snacks to the
hikers. They carry their wares to the booths on their backs. Angelo buys us
prickly-pear cactus fruit. Delicious. You can sometimes buy it at home in the
supermarket. Mind you don't pick up nearly invisible spines from the outer
skin.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-183</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-183.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole and Tim.</B>

Derek takes his own picture in Carole's sunglasses. Ton-ton Macoute style,
like Papadoc Duvalier's henchpeople in Haiti used to wear. They reflect back
the bemused stare of the uneasy onlooker, revealing nothing of the wearer's
intentions.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-184</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-184.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Derek in obstinate mood.</B>

Well, Derek wasn't really being obstinate, like a donkey. Just, feeling
a little quiet, noticing the fatigue of the trail on the first day out.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-186</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-186.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Sorry, THIS is more like him.</B>

Well, perhaps Derek isn't quite so prickly as that. But oddly enough, for his
retirement party, many years ago, he got a cactus that was just as well-armed
as this tree. If this was a hint, he's taken a long time to get the point.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-187</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-187.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole, the only one besides Merle ...</B>

Ok. That previous was a weak attempt at trailside humour. But one or two
people sometimes laugh. There's nothing like a hike or a camping trip to help
you get to know people. I advise it for all those contemplating marriage.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-188</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-188.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>... who would laugh at Derek's jokes.</B>

Another typical trail view, rising higher. An Agave plant. Sends up a tall
fruiting stalk and then the plant dies or goes into dormancy. The seeds,
presumeably, get spread by birds and animals looking for a snack.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-189</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-189.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The Inca trail is also ...</B>

The trail isn't only for hikers. It's a highway for villagers going
about their business. Although not suitable for wheeled vehicles, it carries
a steady stream of local people and pack animals bearing loads of produce
and supplies.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-190</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-190.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>... a commercial corridor.</B>

This pack train is followed by a young lad on a pony somewhere round
the corner up ahead. The animals seem to know exactly where they're
going. They don't deviate right or left and pay no attention to the hikers.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-193</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-193.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The trail rises.</B>

Gaining altitude now. The landscape spreads out as we rise. Less habitation.
That cut on the far side of the valley may be the Machu Picchu Railroad. An
Inca ruin lies beside the tracks on the left side of the river. We're
beginning to be intoxicated by the open air and the heights surrounding us.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-199</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-199.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Still a few hamlets.</B>

A rest stop with the villagers selling treats. Ineke has a one-sided
conversation with that little kid on the right. He accepted a banana for a
snack.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-200</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-200.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Hiker rest stop.</B>

A guide or hiker from another group. This seems to be a regular stopping
place for most tourists coming through.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-202</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-202.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

Two of the ladies who maintain this rest stop. The one on the right has the
typical garb of Quechua mountain women, the fedora hat and petticoats. The
woman on the left, who was in charge of the refreshment stand, dresses like
us. Except for the lack of hiking boots.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-203</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-203.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Portal</B>

A picturesque doorway for Derek's portal collection. He wonders what's behind
it. Gardening tools, grain storage, or do people live in there?

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>d230-087</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/d230/d230-087.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole D: Other facilities.</B>

Aha! We can guess what's inside that door. We don't go in to check, but we
suspect that the owner is trying to salt away the greenbacks for her
retirement fund. Or maybe for a holiday in Regional Niagara.
<BR clear='all'><P><B>June 18 Lunch stop.</B>

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-206</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-206.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

At last, a lunch stop at a regular campsite. One of the group is already
nibbling on the grass. Looks like the site has hydro, no mean achievement
this high up in the mountains.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-204</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-204.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Campground.</B>

Our blue dining tent, with members of the group on the right. The stream may
be fed from Inca channels in the upper mountains collecting rain and
meltwater. Far right, guides are doing dishes, thankfully, upstream from the
donkey.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-208</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-208.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

Waiting for lunch. Those are the blue-wrapped packs of our porters in the
foreground. We loll around, take pictures and chat, enjoying the sunshine of a
perfect day.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-209</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-209.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Gotcha. Porter load, right.</B>

Carole ambushes me with a snap. Our porters carry their loads in these blue
bags with a blanket wrapped round shoulders and forehead while they cling to
the straps. They don't have the full backpacks used by more affluent
outfitters, such as The Gap.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-210</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-210.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>M. ac-cumulus-ating Inca wisdom.</B>

Cumuli rise in the background. We stroll around grooving on the ambiance of
the site. Only we seniors know what it is to "groove" on anything.
<BR clear='all'><P><B>June 18 Day 1, pm.</B>

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-217</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-217.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Upwarder and onwarder.</B>

After lunch, more altitude to gain. Up through slopes of bromeliads and
grasses long gone into seasonal maturity.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-218</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-218.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

Crossing small bridges, over rivulets feeding eventually into the Urubamba
River.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-219</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-219.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

We seem to be leaving the last villages behind. You can see a hydro tower in
the valley. Perhaps an Inca ruin at centre. The trail is so well used that
you're seldom out of sight of other hikers. 500 per day, we heard. Even so,
not so congested that we bump into each other.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-222</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-222.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Still a few farms.</B>

Some agriculture even at this height. The cows look healthy though nibbling
on last year's grass. The hills appear to have contour lines. Probably animal
tracks. Centuries of foraging have produced a kind of miniature terracing
effect.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-223</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-223.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

We're moving briskly along now, but still outpaced by the porters. The
surrounding mountains are visible in full magnificence. A typical trail
section here of beaten gravel. Few stairs, no clambering, but a steady
ascent.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-223A</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-223A.jpeg">
<I>V11-10-10</I> - <B>On the trail FX</B>

Here's my first example of what I call the photo-sketch
technique. It's done in the studio after the foot slogging is
over with. Not always easy to predict what might make a good p-s
picture. I try to document the trip, with "standard" picture
treatment, first of all. That means taking a lot of contextual
pictures, not only stunning views. But the best photos
frequently make the best photo sketches.
<P>The "scenic" approach to scenery?</B>
Back in the studio I usually test a picture by printing it 11x17
and standing it up scenically with others on the mantelpiece.
For artistic purposes the "good" pictures are the ones that are
intelligible and interesting from across the room. What is this
"across the room" quality? To my eye, it consists of a
recognisable and iconic structure, and often a kind of thematic
quality.
 How about: "Figures in a landscape" for instance? A picture
doesn't have to be titled this way. But it helps me to imagine
that a picture could have some such wider association. Having
some inkling of a picture's thematic agenda could also help in
the evaluation of the different components of a picture, and in
the studio work of taking a purely photographic image and
decluttering, strengthening it with line and tonal adjustments.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-224</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-224.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Terraced Inca site.</B>

We begin to pass stupendous Inca sites like this one. The upper buildings
comprised storehouses and accommodation for workers and guard people. The
scalloped edges below apparently had some significance in Inca iconography.
Possibly to represent the coils of a serpent. The raised terrace would also
be above rainy season flood levels.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-224A</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-224A.jpeg">
<I>V11-10-10</I> - <B>Terraced Inca site FX</B>

This version illustrates a pitfall of using digital techniques
to do something very close to what the sketcher or watercolourist
often does. The tool here emphasises edges. Natural scenes
frequently have plenty of broken rock and foliage, and the
challenge is to restrain the edge effects to essential details.
Otherwise the picture takes on the cluttered quality of an
overworked sketch, one overpopulated with irrelevant details.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-229</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-229.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Higher site.</B>

Probably for surveillance and communications. The Inca Trail
was a highway linking settlements, hence the need for refreshment and relay
stations to serve commercial and administrative traffic. Hikers visible, left.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-232</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-232.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

Closer to that site. Impressive, although the roofing is long gone. Looks
like it's been partially restored or stabilized. Certainly very neat.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-236</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-236.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Sheer walls beside us.</B>

Rockscapes. You wouldn't want to tackle these directly unless
you were a mountaineer.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-237</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-237.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Farm fields below.</B>

Just when I think we've left it all behind, more farmland. Looks like a
harvest under way. The lower field just cut, ladies gathering grain in piles.
Horse and donkey in the upper field. Tarp laid out to dry or thresh grain.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-238</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-238.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>I had hoped this was our campsite.</B>

By this time it's late afternoon. But we don't go down that side
trail and cross the bridge. So I have to postpone my rest till
later, much later.
...

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-241</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-241.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The trail leads ever onwards.</B>

Angelo points the way. Somewhere up ahead is a tent with an air mattress and
a sleeping bag. I'm looking forward to making their acquaintance. A spot of
dinner wouldn't be turned down either.

<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>Shadow-highlights</B>

Mountain photography has a problem, especially at dawn and dusk. The valleys
are dark, the heights brilliant. The camera compromises, underexposing the
valleys and overexposing the heights. Digital processing to the rescue.
Some camera software has an option to solve this very problem.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-244</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-244.jpeg">
<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>Last village.</B>

A few substantial buildings in this last village. Feisty chickens in the
dooryard. Nice woodwork on the porch of that house on the right. Are those
ears of corn drying on the roof?

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-245</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-245.jpeg">
<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>Geranium hedge.</B>

A geranium hedge eight feet high. I've never seen geraniums as big as that.

<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>Checkpoint on the trail.</B>

You can't get past without proper documentation and passport.
There were problems with unrestricted access in the past. The
authorities don't want anyone on the loose building campfires
without supervision, or without contributing to the park's
revenue stream. That spectacled bear on the wall is the park's
mascot, Irena, by name.

Strange little bridges cross rivulets that probably drain eventually into
the Urubamba.

<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>Human femur and skull top.</B>

A bit of a shocker beside the trail:  A hiker from another group points
into this shallow cave where I find a human femur and skull top. 
Probably a burial long ago that has become exposed due to erosion or
vandalism. It could have been an Inca burial.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-260</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-260.jpeg">
<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>Lunch.</B>

Lunch time. A light meal of sandwiches and cool drinks on improvised picnic
table and benches. Every so often you encounter patches of substantial
vegetation like these trees, where the configuration of the land convinces
rainclouds to part with some of their moisture. Those are bromeliads on the
branches. Their reddish spikey leaves are not part of the tree.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-262</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-262.jpeg">

More patches of cloud forest. The trail's stone paving and steps are almost
continuous now, replacing the compacted gravel of earlier.

Glimpses down into damp little gullies where trickles of water eventually

Play of light and shadow. Can be quite dark in here with the heavy tree
growth. Contrasts with brighter conditions on the open trail. The
automatic exposure setting of my camera was unable to cope and still give a
fast enough shutter speed for hand held pictures.

<I>09-06-19</I> - <B>New peaks on the horizon.</B>

Mount Veronica is left behind. This one, very symmetrical, almost a normal
curve. You can still see way down into the valley below with a few farm
fields visible.

A final rest stop before the big push. This is actually a campsite, not used
at present. We're recruiting our strength to get to the top of the pass that
you can now see on the left. We have to get all the way up there and then far
down the other side this afternoon.

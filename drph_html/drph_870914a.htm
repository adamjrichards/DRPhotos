<P>
<P>     The last day of the Learned Societies Conference at U.B.C.,
after delivering a sparkling paper on the history of Canadian
Alpinism -- to one old friend, two bored fur trade economists
and a pert young woman who came in by mistake -- Richard was
nearly convinced to opt for early retirement. This was also at a
point in academic life when "publish or perish" had become the
operative factor. In short, he was having a mid-career on top of
a mid-life crisis.
<P>    Last summer in New England he'd talked Tanya into coming to
this conference with him. It was supposed to be a working
holiday. When the happy date finally arrived, their flight was
late. The registration people put them in separate rooms. And
Tanya had an overcrowded slate of conference sessions to attend.
Not to mention chairing evening meetings of the Higher Arcanum
of Linguistics, East European Branch. He'd at least managed to
set up an appointment to meet her for lunch -- for the good of
the firm, so to speak.
<P>    While pondering his academic future (and his marriage), it
seemed a good idea at the time to go on a meditative walk to
keep the vital fluids circulating, just in case they might come
in handy in any final grapple with destiny.
<P>
<P>    A path led to Wreck Beach from a gap in the trees behind the
Anthropology Museum. Down a shadowed stairway on the side of a
ferny cliff, to a patch of bright sand visible at the bottom.
Then, the Strait of Georgia, wide and inviting: new horizons
with islands and mountains in the blue distance. Down the shore,
someone strolled into the waves, hands on hips, naked. Ah, the
eternal verities.
<P>    Feet scuffled on the steps and a young woman wearing a
conference name-tag emerged from the shadows, blinking in the
sun. She briefly considered the view, then came in Richard's
direction. It was the same person who'd wandered into his
lecture by accident.
<P>    "Hello again. I enjoyed your talk on mountain climbing. Do
you happen to know if there's any other way to get up the cliff
from down the beach? I was planning to hike all the way along."
<P>    A brief map consultation assured her of several more access
routes in either direction. They continued together, paces
matching, a couple of polite strangers who couldn't figure out
how to say goodbye. She revealed her interest in health and
fitness, while he, with a long telephoto lens on his camera, and
the debacle of his ill-attended lecture still rankling, decided
to adopt the pose of a serious bird-watcher.
<P>    Further on, they met signs of a regular overnight campsite
among the piles of driftwood. The remains of huge bonfires
smouldered fragrantly, wide patches of white ash carpeting the
sand. A sleeping bag twitched and groaned; arms protruded,
fingers flexing for morning exercise. To Richard, a vision of
the ideal life: Elysium right next door to Academe.
<P>    "Say, I wonder if anyone from the Conference slept down here
last night?"
<P>    Before his companion could comment, a female figure, whose
face, at least, was familiar from a seminar on architectural
conservation in the Yukon, reared up (literally) from behind a
log, turned and surveyed the morning scene. Beside her, the
bearded face of her research assistant peeped out more
cautiously. The woman fluffed up her hair, cast the world a
negligent look and turned over on her back. Her profile appeared
to Richard, who often got misty-eyed about scenery, like the far
horizon above Capilano Canyon. Twin peaks looming over bosky
depths. His companion was discreetly looking the other way.
<P>    They stood in the marketplace of a nudist colony, surrounded
by the debris of last night's partying and the bodies of
late-waking beachcombers. Exposed on their left, a pair of
notable buttocks twitched comfortably in the sun's increasing
warmth. To the right, a naked couple squatted on opposite sides
of a campfire, puffing at uncooperative embers, bodies covered
with particles of fly ash, making terse suggestions as to how
the other should "move their ass", or even, "get their <I>own</I> ass
in gear", the better to speed up breakfast preparations. A
perfect tableau of the marital state.
<P>    To avoid disrupting the folkways of an endangered species,
Richard pretended to be fascinated with nautical events. "Hmm,
wonder what's happening out there on the briny deep?"
<P>    "Tug boats pulling timber rafts." His companion glowered
across the waves. "Only a few hundred more acres of old-growth
forest gone forever." Still frowning, she turned back to stare,
disapprovingly, Richard thought, at the nudists.
<P>    "Well," he waffled, "I suppose this is as about as far as we
can go ... er, in this direction."
<P>    For something to do, he removed the lens cap from his camera
and aimed at a flying seagull, ostentatiously shooting <I>above</I>
the heads of the nearby sun-worshippers to publicly demonstrate
total lack of morbid interest. Then both turned and strolled
back through the gauntlet the opposite way.
<P>    Being fully clothed in a gathering of nudists gives rise to
a peculiar, inverted form of embarrassment. It's the exact
reverse of those dreams where you imagine yourself naked in a
crowd, wondering if anyone notices. But unfortunately for the
novice nudist, to seek relief by conforming to the
locally-accepted standard still entails feelings of guilt with
respect to the larger society.
<P>    The westward route led back toward the less-frequented part
of the beach. Here they ambled along, with Richard idly
commenting on cloud formations and wading shore birds (trying
all the while not to seem like he was following her around), and
with her searching the bank for signs of edible asparagus. It
seemed that she was also some kind of organic food enthusiast.  
<P>    At the northward turn toward Burrard Inlet, a pile of stones
extended into the water. Back of this, an odd concrete structure
painted with explosive grafitti. He was just saying: "The next
stairway back up to the campus should be somewhere ahead ..."
when a middle-aged gentleman hiker approached from the opposite
direction: bushy grey beard, fiery red nose, somewhat slab-sided
in build, but well tanned. He bore down on them with a rucksack
on his back, a staff in his hand, wearing sneakers and nothing
else.  His eyes took in everything with a beady-eyed, hawk-like
stare. They fastened on Richard.
<P>    A generous cluster of private parts swung to a snare-drum
beat as the hiker marched toward them.  Caught between the
penetrating stare above and the unmentionable giblets below,
Richard found no acceptable place to rest his eyes.  A line from
some nonsense poem of Edward Lear about "The Dong with a
luminous Nose" started running through his head, or was it "The
Nose with the luminous ...?"
<P>    "... As I was saying, there <I>has</I> to be another stairway
around here somewhere ..." He struggled to pick up the thread of
his sentence with the idea of shielding his companion from the
awful explicitness of male nudity. The man was now close enough
to rub shoulders with them. To have ignored him would have been
uncool. "... Er, maybe <I>you</I> can help us. We were wondering
about that building over there. Have <I>you</I> any idea what it's
for?" Richard's question came out in a kind of falsetto. He
tried to mask his confusion by clearing his throat.
<P>    "It's a World War II gun emplacement," the hiker informed
them, pleased with their interest and stopping to dangle awhile.
"See back there? Pillboxes dug into the side of the cliff.
Entrance hatches in the Faculty Club parking lot up above. They
fortified the point in case of an enemy landing from Georgia
Strait. This bunker had a cannon upstairs pointing out to sea.
Been coming down here since I was a kid in the forties. Seen it
all."
<P>    It seemed prudent just to smile pleasantly and refrain from
detailed comment in case this might unleash a protracted lecture
on local history. But the girl seemed puzzled about something.
<P>    "Say, did you ever find any cannon balls?" Her voice was
high and earnest. "My brother's got a metal detector. He might
like to come down here and search for buried treasure."
<P>    "Nah, nothing left. They sold it all for scrap after the
war. And anyway, they didn't use cannon balls anymore in those
days. They had shells -- you know: brass cartridges with long,
pointed bullets on the end."
<P>    Eyes skyward! ... yearning for another distracting seagull.
<P>    "Really?" The girl sounded awestruck at the breadth of the
man's experience. ... Or maybe it was the length, thought
Richard with a touch of envy.
<P>    "Well, so long," said the hiker, hip muscles alternately
pulsating as he marched away down the beach in the direction
they'd just come. "Have fun." The snare-drum beat died away in
the distance. Bruum, bruum, br-um-tum-tum. Richard turned slowly
to face his companion.
<P>    "I think your escape route is back that way," he whispered
in a strangled tone, pointing out the vestiges of a roadway
leading up the bank toward the campus.
<P>    "Escape route? Oh! So there is." She stared at him curiously
a moment.
<P>    "And best of luck with all your future endeavours," he
added, apropos of nothing, turning away to set his own
grey-bearded, red-nosed face toward the sea. It wasn't that he
was against nudity, far from it. It was just that one felt
personally responsible for having inflicted a male anatomy
lesson on an innocent young girl.
<P>
<P>    The seaward side of the rocks seemed sheltered from
intrusion. His recent companion had just gone up the bank toward
the campus, and a man and woman, who'd been invisible from the
path, were in the act of pulling on clothes. They soon departed
up the beach leaving him in solitary possession of the rockpile.
Sitting down on a boulder, he tried to remember what it was like
in the sixties to be "laid-back".
<P>    The Gulf Islands beckoned in the west. To the north across
the inlet rose a heroic backdrop of mountains. Merely looking at
that scenery gave him a feeling of renewal. The germ of an
inspiration formed: why not take a cue from nature and local
custom? Solve his mid-career crisis by becoming a modern Ponce
de Leon, bathing in the fountain of youth.
<P>    A glance down the beach revealed no one in the vicinity. He
peeled off clothes, piling them on a higher stone to advertise
a desire for privacy should anyone come along. His camera bag
fitted conveniently into a crevice beneath the rocks. Then, on a
sun-warmed boulder with gentle breezes searching out the hidden
crannies of his anatomy, he considered the future, staring at
the waves and ready for any rejuvenating thoughts that might
bubble up.
<P>    Richard's biography of James Fielding, the 19th century
explorer, was well under way, and the work had turned up spicy
side issues that could be the subject of companion articles.
Particularly, Fielding's relationship with Catherine Montague
(alias Mrs. Maidstone) the artist. In time, the public might
take to it, but the academic community, it seemed, would prefer
learned dissertations on political, economic and constitutional
trivia.
<P>    Not to forget his own companion in life, attending a lecture
back up on campus at this very moment. Would she endure another
summer of alfresco research like their canoe trip on Georgian
Bay? Drag herself to the top of windy ridges in the Rocky
Mountains, just to stand beside him on the spot where his hero
had once stood? Slog through muddy swamps and paddle up obscure
creeks? Tramp the badlands behind some occasional professor of
"The History and Philosophy of Outdoor Ed?"
<P>    And yet, they had some of their best times on those trips,
sleeping on the ground in wet sleeping bags, ravaged by
mosquitoes, bone-weary. She would always complain that they
never went to New York and Paris, and yet, out there among the
blackflies, they did enjoy a sense of emancipation.  The agenda
of life simplified itself into where to camp for the night, or
what flavour of pasta to have for supper. They'd spend hours
searching for the perfect vantage point for a picture to
illustrate some lecture of his in the next term. And the rest of
the time, their main problem was finding enough smooth rocks,
patches of moss and beds of bushy grass so they could press
thighs together, heedless of startled wildlife or low-flying
aircraft.
<P>    Back from these nomadic excursions, life was far more
luxurious but a lot less contented. Digestion would deteriorate,
the vital juices congeal and a grey blanket descend as she coped
with her own academic course load and he prepared lectures and
endured the day-to-day horror of faint praise from tenure-track
colleagues.
<P>
<P>    Getting down into the water required a tricky balancing act
on barnacle-covered rocks. But it was unthinkable to leave
Vancouver without a token skinny-dip on Wreck Beach -- the
Ganges of his generation. Wading knee-deep soon made it clear
that wet feet are even more vulnerable to barnacles than dry
ones. He edged cautiously out till he could squat down and
baptize himself. Just in time. Two fully-clothed strollers
approached down the path. Complacently immersed, he ignored
them.
<P>    Nearer at hand, a heron stalked that line where the waves
turned to foam.  A true beachcomber, strolling the shores of
life, wings folded like arms behind his back: Richard's alter
ego, doomed by solitary habits to patrol a shifting buffer zone
between the squalid rookeries of academe and freedom to starve
on the open seas of commercial publishing. And the noisy
seagull, another colleague of his, gregarious as all get out and
just as happy at some parking lot of a university as on the most
idyllic shoreline.
<P>    Concealing waves broke over his shoulders. The two
strollers, both over-dressed in respectable dark blue suits,
were now inspecting the old World War II concrete bunker at the
back of the beach. One had massive shoulders and a bald head,
wore dark glasses and carried a brief-case, of all things to see
on Wreck Beach. The other, apparently in charge, waved a cane
in Richard's direction. Were these the same two heavies who'd
been manning the Prentice-Hall booth up at the conference book
display? They now clambered toward him over the rocks.
<P>    Incredibly, the hulking one began began stuffing Richard's
clothes into his brief-case. Dammit, wasn't an old veteran of
the sixties entitled to a little solitude in his declining
years? This reaction came more from a sense of outraged privacy
than from any thought of preventing theft.
<P>    Then, with a "pfuut" and a slapping sound, some vicious
insect stung him on the shoulder.
<P>    "HEY!," Richard yelped, swatting in all directions like a
parody of a multi-armed Hindu god. "What the fuck's going on?"
... No offense meant to Our Lady Aphrodite. In the stress of the
moment, the sacred F-word just sort of popped out in a
secular context.
<P>    Richard leaped from the water and bounded forward, exposing
himself to public outrage. The next instant: flat on his face,
frantically grabbing for handholds beneath the surf.
<P>    Barnacle attack! The nerves in his feet screamed an alarm as
he clung to a rock and fought for air, blinking salt water and
nearly fainting with the pain. The two blue-suited hooligans
were already trotting briskly away down the beach.
<P>    The water ran pink with blood as he waded cautiously to
shore among the razor-coated rocks. A large boulder above the
tide line provided a place to sit and inspect the damage.
Luckily the wounds weren't deep, and thanks to the antiseptic
effect of the salt water, would probably heal fast. No one in
sight. He turned lacerated soles toward the sun and leaned back
to recapture a little composure.
<P>    His clothes! Waking up with a start, he gawked round for the
rock where he'd piled his things. Nothing.
<P>    Hyenas! Running dogs! Hooligans! ... Now wait a minute,
Peters. Refugees from the laid-back sixties shouldn't be quite
so judgemental. Maybe those characters in the blue suits were
innocent after all. Perhaps they'd simply missed seeing him and
were now taking his clothes, like good Boy Scouts, to the lost
and found. His camera bag, thank goodness, was still in its
concealing crevice.
<P>    His lunch appointment with Tanya gave him a a classic
dilemma: Miss it with no credible excuse and further strain an
already creaky relationship. Or make his shakey debut as a UBC
streaker. How to get back onto the campus, naked as a stranded
jellyfish, sneak up to his room, and locate a first-aid kit in
time? Another half-hour lying on the rocks pretending to be a
sun-worshipper convinced him the problem wouldn't go away. The
only solution was either to hide till dark or dart from bush to
bush in broad daylight, hoping to find concealment between here
and the residence.
<P>    Desperation mounted as a succession of bright ideas passed
in review. How about telephoning for someone to bring fresh
clothes? Dammit, no coins. His wallet was gone along with his
pants; and in any case, no phone booths on Wreck Beach.
<P>    Pedestrian traffic up and down the sand got heavier as the
noon hour approached, and very few of the tourists were nudists
like himself. No choice but to come out of the closet or find a
better hiding place. He tip-toed bloodily across the rocks to
the World War II bunker and stepped inside to take a look.
Useless for hiding, the place was a hollow shell, plastered with
grafitti about rock bands and teen-age sex. But an old pair of
running shoes lay in a corner and the fit was almost right.
<P>    Upstairs via an iron ladder, the bunker offered no better
concealment. Here the paint of the grafitti seemed even fresher.
It would be like hiding naked in a New York subway station. More
sign painters might appear any minute and apply their slogans to
his defenceless hide. Wow, an inspired idea. How about painting
on a pair of pants? Next in the way of zany alternatives: the
plan of climbing up on the roof and lying very, very prone. By
sunset, his body would resemble a par-boiled lobster.
Concealment was hopeless.
<P>    Nothing left but to walk up the beach in the altogether and
hope to find a plastic garbage bag or shred of cloth big enough
to double as a fig leaf. At least the running shoes protected
his wounded feet from the sand. But oozing blood glued heels to
insoles and each step produced a tearing sensation like sticking
plaster being pulled loose.
<P>    A fully-clad couple strolled toward him. A new nightmare:
feet stuck in molasses while the monster approaches. How to walk
naturally and avoid grimacing with pain, when each step felt
like dipping the foot in hot glue and wrenching it free again.
Was it better to whistle nonchalantly and pretend the innocence
of Eden? Cover the privates with a hand and turn demurely
sideways? Or lengthen his camera strap to present a swinging SLR
in place of a manhood?
<P>    Stopping short with a better inspiration, he raised his
camera and turned seaward. It was simple: take a picture of
something, anything. The heron strode into the viewfinder. It
was second nature to focus and squeeze off a shot. The couple
strolled past in grim silence -- more shots in rapid succession.
Look busy, Peters. Click-wind. Click-wind. ... Now if only this
damn thing had a motor-drive, then he could really crank off the
frames-per-second.
<P>    The strollers went on, not appearing to notice either the
heron or the photographer. Something clicked in Richard's head.
With a camera pressed to his skull, the photographer becomes
invisible.  He continued down the beach taking a fresh interest
in ornithology.
<P>    "Hi, there!" she chirped, bursting out of the bushes. "I went
back to get a towel and some lunch. Thought I'd go for a swim."
<P>    It was the same young lady he'd run into earlier. The one
who'd come to his lecture by mistake, and in whose company he'd
met the red-nosed, grey-bearded, and very naked gentleman hiker
who told them about Allied plans for defending Wreck Beach
against amphibious invasion. But now, he was in the same state
of undress as the hiker, and she was in the same state as he.
She fell in beside him, cramming a pair of jeans into a
rucksack.
<P>    "I think the swimming's way better down at the other end."
<P>    "I found that out already."
<P>    Congealed blood was starting to glue the running shoes
permanently onto the soles of his feet. He squidged along in
gloom, his mind reeling back and forth between the topics of
blood, nudity and lunch.
<P>    "Been taking pictures?" she persisted.
<P>    "A few birds. Oh, and there he is again."
<P>    His esteemed colleague, the heron, had flown up the beach a
hundred yards, re-alighted and resumed his stalking through the
surf. The camera dangled against Richard's belly with every
step. Lagging behind the girl to compose a picture would make
him invisible.
<P>    She was quite petite, with a cute red rucksack perched high
on her back. Beneath it, a pair of exquisitely formed and
slightly prominent buttocks. She stopped and turned his way. He
turned to the heron and raised the camera. Everything went black
till he remembered to take off the lens cap. Then, while
estimating the optimum exposure from the LED readout in the
viewfinder, his own Light Emitting Diode began to glow: a unique
technical challenge, a problem of concentration never discussed
in the photographic magazines.
<P>    They walked on, a bright flush rising on his cheeks. It
seemed best after all to walk slightly ahead of her, doing
mental exposure calculations all the way. Hopefully, the
distraction would have the effect of keeping things to a
minimum. But it was hard to restrain the urge to bend over and
check. At least, by discreetly rolling eyeballs downward past
his moustache, nothing but a telephoto lens protruded into his
field of vision.
<P>    Another couple strolled toward them, fully clothed. An
alarming out-of-body experience hit him. A vision of a tanned,
middle-aged greybeard with a red nose, dangling meatily down the
beach, accompanied by a pert and voluptuously full-frontal girl,
probably in her teens. Only now, the graybeard was Richard
Peters.
<P>    "Far out, there's the heron again." He turned to do a bit
more birding. "Want to see him through my 500mm lens?"
<P>    "Say, that's quite a bazooka barrel you've got there.
Doesn't that thing stick out a little too far to use without a
tripod?" she piped, just as the other two passed behind them.
<P>    "Er ... you have to spread your legs apart, lean back a
little, and firmly grip the knurled ring," he said with a tremor
in his voice.
<P>
<P>    Down among the nudists at the east end of the beach, they
were safe for the time being. His companion took off her
rucksack, spread out a towel and began pulling out plastic bags.
<P>    "I brought some lunch. Want to share it? There's plenty."
<P>    He smiled back. Other than shooting a series of promising
heron pictures, this was his first real piece of luck today.
Taking the lids off containers, she laid out an assortment of
carrots, sprouts and croutons, then handed him a plastic fork.
<P>    "Dig in," she urged. "I'm sorry, I didn't bring any plates."
<P>    They assumed lotus positions, the towel forming a table
cloth on the sand between them.  It took Richard noticeably
longer to force his joints into a comfortable posture.
<P>    "Try the carrots, they're really crisp."
<P>    An embarrassingly large and phallic specimen found its way
into his clumsy paw. Resisting at first, his teeth severed it
with a snap, leaving a huge chunk to masticate. Meanwhile she
was watching him expectantly.
<P>    "Good aren't they?"  Her only answer was the sound of
chewing. "Don't you like organic food?  Oh dear, I bet you'd
prefer a steak and two boiled vegetables for lunch?"
<P>    "No, no, I enjoy salads a lot ..." Who wants to be typified
as stodgy and middle-aged, especially by an agreeably naked
female.  "People eat far too much meat these days.  Didn't
UNESCO or FAO or somebody calculate that the average adult
needs only 28 grams of protein a day? or was it 280?"
<P>    "Really!" She seemed more anxious to endorse his latent
vegetarianism than to question his statistics.
<P>    When the carrot was finished and his jaws were sore, he
turned to the less demanding celery sticks. She picked up a
container of macaroni salad and speared a forkful, all the while
following his every movement with those wide, bright eyes of
hers, full of the optimism of youth.
<P>    A clump of macaroni evaded her fork and tumbled over the
edge of the container to land ... to nestle in the triangle of
her pubic hair. She looked down at it, then flashed a startled
look full into his eyes.
<P>    She raked out the larger pieces with her fork and replaced
them carefully in the salad container. Traces of mayonnaise
still clung to her ... apron. Abruptly, she put down the
container and covered her face with her hands.
<P>    "Do you know what I've gone and done?" For a moment he
thought she was going to cry.
<P>    "What's that?" It was difficult to plead ignorance, staring
directly at that mayonnaise spot.
<P>    "I've put it back in the container. Now you won't want to
eat any." She looked at him sadly, the image of a disappointed
hostess.
<P>    Modesty was clearly not the issue. He took up the container
and raised it ceremoniously in the air. Collecting macaroni, and
a few other curly bits, on the plastic fork, he held it up like
someone making a toast, then passed it between his lips as
sensually as he dared. A smile formed at the corners of his
mouth as he chewed and swallowed with exaggerated relish. An
erotic eating scene in the film <I>Tom Jones</I> (which this girl
would probably never have seen) went through his head. She began
brushing at her mayonnaised apron -- only succeeding in getting
sand in the mayonnaise -- then broke into gusty laughter.
<P>    "Tell me more about mountain climbing," she said. He
cheerfully obliged.
<P>    When the lunch things and the conversation were finally
packed away, she stretched out to sunbathe on the sand. Richard
leaned back against a nearby log and tried to keep his eyes on
the horizon. Lucky for him, photogenic cumuli hovered over the
islands to the west and provided an opportunity to compose a
cloud study in his viewfinder. He wondered if Catherine Montague
had looked like this without any clothes on. But surely her
voice must have been closer to the contralto range.
<P>    She opened one eye against the glare and peered in his
direction. "Coming?" She rolled her body toward him. He stared,
shocked at the tone of invitation and at his own associations
with the word. "... Coming swimming? The water's warm."
<P>    "I think I'll have to pass it up. Cut my feet this morning
down at the other end of the beach."
<P>    Getting up, she stood quite close for an instant, her body
dusted with a glitter of fine particles. "I'm going in and get
cleaned up. See you later." She sprinted across the sand and
splashed into the water. Had she put an unusual emphasis on the
word "you"?
<P>    Down the beach, the heron continued to stalk the wavering
band of shallows between breaking wave and shore. An opportunity
to take a few more souvenir pictures of wading shore birds,
including the human kind. Finally replacing the lens cap,
Richard snatched up the towel, wrapped it round his hips and
began jogging back toward the campus, inwardly groaning at every
step.
<P>    Out of reach of his hostess's ire, he slowed to a limp,
feeling strangely wicked: not just for stealing her towel --
that could be returned with a note of apology to the address on
the label sewn into the corner -- but for admiring her youthful
womanhood without playing the usual game.
<P>    What she'd really expected, he'd never know: "See you later"
with a gleam in her eye. That one phrase could have meant so
much, and so little.
<P>    Still wrapped in her towel, he climbed the stairs to the
campus and walked past the back of the Anthropology Museum.
Through a glass wall, a Haida mask looked darkly out, eyeing
the succulent white man.
<P>    Sudden footfalls rustled in the grass behind him. ... Heart
thumping, he barely resisted the temptation to twist round and
see if it was her. When he finally got up courage, no one was
there. He walked back to the residence feeling unreasonably
elated, feral, somehow.
<P>    It could have been the result of bathing in Ponce de Leon's
magic fountain. Then again, it could have been the curly bits in
the macaroni salad.

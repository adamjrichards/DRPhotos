<BR>This is Derek's oldest slide show. It began as a 35 milimeter slide show
with a stereo audio tape to drive the slide projector. The synchronisation
was maintained by a series of timed beeps on one channel of the sound track.
The narrative was on the other channel. The beeps were fed through a set
of primitive electronic gadgets to the slide projector. Each beep advanced
the projector one slide. If all went well, the show remained in
synchronization to the end. Audio quality was limited by the makeshift
tape-recorders originally used to capture the narrative.
<BR>
<BR> In 1996 The slides that made up the show were scanned to computer and
the original audio tape digitized. The slides needed considerable editing to
remove dust and to bring the image quality up to digital standards. The
audio tape had to be digitally edited to cut the narrative into individual
audio files for each slide.

<BR>    In 1975 our holiday trip takes us to Killbear and Killarney Provincial
Parks. Killbear Park is on the northern point of land enclosing Parry Sound
Harbour. (Show map?)

<BR>We discover several distinct tenting areas in separated parts of the Park --
each with an individual character. We stay at Blind Bay on the protected
inner side of the point. Picking the largest campsite available, we arrange
five tents in a semicircle with rain-flys stretched overhead. The Richards
compound looks like a village in the woods.

<BR>   We have a few misgivings about bringing guinea pigs on a camping trip, but it
<BR>                  seems easier than finding a pig sitter back in St. Catharines.

<BR>Nathan spends a lot of time diving for clams. Nobody knows why: just because

<BR>Next, we decide to do some messing about in boats. So we go to this marina to
rent a canoe.

<BR>One day Merle and I go out chasing sailboats. She has her eye on boarding

<BR>One member of the expedition prefers to stay at home and maintain the harbour
defences, well-sheltered from the waves and breezes farther out.

<I>0054-25 </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>We do lots of things besides swimming. With nature trails as well paved as
this one, leading mysteriously off into the woods on every side, we just have
to go exploring. At least, that's what I want to do. Miriam doesn't look so
enthusiastic.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0054/0054-22.jpeg">

<BR>Sometimes the adventure is only to discover small delicate things beside the
path: like mushrooms ...

<BR>Sometimes we reach a high lookout -- probably planned by the builder of the
trail as a bait to lure sluggish campers away from their tents.

<BR>Another hike takes us along the coast to Lover's Bluff -- at least that's
what I bluff Merle into thinking it's called.

<BR>How would Lowell Thomas, maker of travel films, have phrased it? "As the last

passed through here.

<BR>The village of Killarney lies at the end of 42 miles of side road off the
main route north from Pary Sound to Sudbury. The main street goes roughly
south-east. Pittfield's general store is that prominent white building down
at the end.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0054/0054-86.jpeg">

<BR>Killarney may be one of the only towns in Ontario where the liquor store has
its own dock. See the sign on the left?

<I>0054-87 </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Looking north-west, now, you can see taxpayers taking advantage of recent
improvements to the government wharf. The Sportsman's Inn where we rented
canoes is visible in the background.

<BR>Killarney Provincial Park is full when we arrive, so we head out to Teddy
Lamorandiere's campsite on the edge of town. Those are our tents beside that
mound of pink rock, blue and orange in the distance.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0054/0054-81.jpeg">
<I>0054-81 </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>It's worth a stay at this commercial campsite just to see these large
polished stones. I have a feeling they might have had a mystic significance
to the original inhabitants of the area.

<BR>Our tents are pitched near the shore of Killarney Bay which is sheltered from
the full sweep of Georgian Bay by several large islands.

these weeds.

<BR>In the fields and woods around the campsite, we find plenty of debris. But it
doesn't really seem like garbage. In a rural area like this, discarded toys

gracefully than litter in the city.

<BR>While we explore and sit on the rocks at Lamorandiere's campsite, Merle and
Miriam have succeeded in getting us a place in the provincial park. They have
to hang around the front gate until someone reluctantly goes home and leaves
us a free campsite.

<BR>Looking back toward the campsite, a keen eye might be able to pick up some
canoes pulled up on the shore of George Lake near the centre of the picture.

<BR>On another day, Diana, Nathan and I take a hike along the north shore of
George Lake looking for more rocks to climb.

<BR>We start and end at this beach. You can reach it by a trail through the woods
from the main campsite.

<BR>Canoeing parties sometimes camp on the shore near here. It's convenient to
the Park entrance if you're just beginning or ending a trip.

<BR>This tree might come in handy to grab if you were sliding down these slippery
rocks toward the water.

<I>0054-138 </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Higher up and back from the lake, we find another kind of rock. This calls
for a much more serious climbing effort. Diana explores a crack by wedging
herself in and worming upward.

<I>0054-139 </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Nathan tries it too. But the rock is loose and crumbling, and since we don't
have a rope or safety helmets, we decide to turn back.

<BR>Down at the water's edge, this old tree root is probably the relic of a
forest fire.

<BR>Nathan makes friends with a dragon instead of slaying it. Eventually it hums
into life and flies away across the water.

<BR>Seeing all those happy wanderers out on canoe trips makes us want to try it.
On two separate occasions we go off on an overnight outing, with me taking
two of the children each time. Here are Nathan and Miriam at the end of our
first portage looking ahead to the next leg of the trip.

<BR>Freeland Lake, between the first and second portages into Killarney Lake, is
unusual for the number and size of its water lilies.

<BR>We camp for the night on Killarney Lake. Here's the spot we stopped for lunch
the next day -- right beside this log with a tree growing out the end.

<BR>Rising above the shore is the most strenuous piece of climbing so far. After
tiring ouselves out scrambling through the woods ...

<I>0054-160 </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>we reach a point where we have to choose between a very long detour and going
up this cliff. Nathan and Miriam are determined to swarm up at all cost. I'm
worried that the real top of the hill may still be much further back. Worse
still, we might get up there and find it impossible to go on -- or to get
back down again. But with the example of Mallory and Irvine before us, we
cling to every crack and crevice ...

looking back toward the Park entrance. Georgian Bay is visible on the
horizon.

Killarney Lake where our canoe is parked.

<BR>Editing History: {hist}
<BR>
<BR> 75 or 76 created 
<BR> 86-03-16 revised
<BR> 87-10-05 revised
<BR> 06-01-06 revised to add "gra" tags from camera files. Quick and dirty
capture by setting up camera in front of projctor.
<BR> 07-04-24: rescanned for higher resolution.
<BR> 07-04-25: cropped, adjusted levels, picked dust. created routine Z6 to
rename sound files. new file name is obtained from comment field, placed
there by word macro.
<BR> 07-04-26: sound seems clear, but a bit tinny? Could be fixed by Cooledit.
Try using Quickfilter with 125hz +10db, 250hz +10db. Test first through
speakers. Fix could be repeated on successive clips via <F2>. Would have
been better to get this right before cutting up the fixed-up tape transcript.
<BR> 07-05-06 some sound files missing. see "missing". 07-05-07 fixed.
<BR> 07-12-14: removed obsolete tags. see below. These were from the first
incarnation of the show. This was made by putting a digital camera in front
of the slide projector and clicking both in sequence, then numbering the
pictures to match the tray slots. The scanned pictures above have the actual
slide numbers.
<BR> 08-11-17: TTS talker can be mixed with audio show. Using delay argument = 1.
This show has no picture captions. Where did they go? The original show had
no captions since it had no computer display.
<BR> 12-10-30: added {#1} bookmarks for treeline slide show.

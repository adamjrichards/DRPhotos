<P><rt-clk> <B>Notes on high-altitude hiking.</B></B>
<BR>You might well ask: why do people go on these trips? They cost a lot of
effort, sometimes also money. They offer very little physical comfort.
There's often the chance of bad weather with no option to retreat to a
comfortable vehicle or hotel. The element of hazard may be significant.
Medical assistance is usually far off, sometimes non-existant. So if you have
a heart attack on the summit of Kilimanjaro, helicopter rescue will be out of
the question due to altitude alone, not to mention lack of cell-phone
coverage. Then there's the fitness issue. You can't, or shouldn't, tackle a
multi-day trek, without a lot of preparation, which can be time-consuming and
boring. You don't have to bicycle laps up the hydro hill every day for a
month in order to get ready for a Caribean cruise. And I won't even bother to
go into the matter of specialized equipment, such as hiking boots, tents,
etc., that may be useless for any other activity.
<BR>
<BR>So WHY then? ... I have to admit, the difficulties do loom larger the older
we get. But we learn to cut corners to keep going as long as possible. For
instance, kayak trips with no portages. Trekking with the added expense of
porters to carry the heavier luggage. Any scheme to experience again those
rare magic moments that you just can't get without total immersion in the
natural environment.  But this isn't to claim that you can't get your quota
of magic moments some other way, only that there IS a special rapport with
their surroundings that outdoor trippers often experience.
<BR>
<BR>I recall a day on Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. This is a 6000ft peak with
a long ascents of perhaps 4500ft from the trailheads in the surrounding
valleys. Starting at 7am we reached the summit, which was clothed in a
freezing cloud, and at about 1pm started down the opposite side. A few
hundred feet down the trail the cloud disappeared, the sun came out and the
air warmed up. This location overlooked the famous Crawford path, which in the
White Mountains of New Hampshire traverses bare ridges of rock for miles and
miles above the tree-line. The view is a perfect metaphor for the human
condition, and a very attractive metaphor, when the sun is shining. Along
this metaphor hundreds of hikers were making their way up and down the trail.
That trail being narrow, essentially single track, we had to step round a
constant stream of people still toiling their way upward. This was at an
altitude of more than 5000ft, no mean eminence in New England. Those still
ascending had come a long way up.
<BR>
<BR>We hadn't expected to see so many people, but the really odd thing was that
practically all of them greeted us like long-lost friends. "How've you been.
Where are you from? Lovely weather. Doesn't this make you glad to be alive?"
They weren't smoking dope or tippling from whiskey-filled canteens, these
people were ecstatic about the stunning views, the trail that went on to the
limit of visibility, the endless ridges of blue mountains in the distance,
one behind the other, the beaming sunshine, their ability to put out
extraordinary effort and still feel happy and fit while doing so, all the
while sensing the comradship of companions on the route, united in a
common project. I'm told that similar ecstatic behaviour can be observed at
rock concerts and hockey games. Told. 
<BR>
<BR>There are also a few essentially perceptual joys to be had while treking at
higher altitudes. Vision. You can see long distances. This sounds obvious
and simplistic. But in our ordinary experience we seldom see very far,
vision is interrupted in every direction by the interior walls of houses,
workplaces, vehicles, and outoors by the streetscape. Even in a "natural"
environment, surrounding trees and hedges preclude the long view. To be able
to see significant details at a very long distance can seem like a
spiritual revelation. Westerners complain that they miss it. Easterners
don't quite know what they're talking about.
<BR>
<BR>It's not enough to just look at the view. You can drive a car to the summit of
Mt Washington. Sure the outlook is impressive that way. But you can't see it
as part of your own personal itinerary in life if you only view it
vicariously and don't take the opportunity to wander in its vastness.
<BR>
<BR>But there's also something special about experiencing up close the very bulk
and mass of rocks, cliffs and peaks, forests, seen as whole communities of
trees, clouds that actually brush past on your own level. Ordinarily we see
most things in close detail, as items, as figures, against a negligible
ground. Way up there, you have moments of seeing the world, not only in terms
of a collection of individual details, but as the very background of your
existence. Here we can sometimes approach, if our blood sugar levels are
calibrated correctly, an almost religious experience. You begin to glimpse
the vast body of a mountain as underlying, sustaining, as providential of new
and challenging experiences. Almost ... as a deity. You could be immortal, for
a few precious hours.

<I>D226-162 09-06-18</I> - <B>Piscacucho</B><xxx>

<BR> We begin at Piscacucho, on the Machu Picchu Railroad. Kilometer 82. Our mini
bus, which has driven us this morning from our hotel in Cuzco, drops us near
the railroad station. We assemble in a staging area with a wonderful view.
The Urubamba River is below. The Inca Trail is on the opposite side.

<BR>The blue bags contain all our tents, sleeping bags, mats, food, fuel,
eating utensils and everything the porters individually might need. We carry
our own personal gear, such as cameras, water, extra clothing and documents.

<I>D226-166 09-06-18</I> - <B>Weighing the loads.</B><xxx>

<BR>The loads are checked at the weighing station on the right. This ensures
that no one is carrying more or less than their fair share. The porter in the
red shirt on the far side is actually hefting a propane tank.

<BR>Here's the group ready to set out. Left to right: Tim, Merle, Ian, Franca,
Ineke our travel agent, Carole, Derek. Full of excitement and bubbles. Here
we're standing beside the Machu Picchu Railroad track, with the river in
back.
<BR>You can see by that lighter line along the bank that the water level is low.
But the flow is still impressive.  The Urubamba is a tributary of the Amazon.
Here, we're on the Atlantic, not the Pacific watershed.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/d230/d230-080.jpeg">
<I>d230-080 09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole D: Bridge across the Urubamba</B><xxx>

<BR>This is a wire-rope suspension bridge that we're about to cross. The hiking
group is on the right. The green gate on the left is where we undergo another
security check to make sure our papers are in order and all our fees paid.
It's not a bridge over troubled waters. The Urubamba seemed very happy that
day. At least to a group of hikers champing at the bit to get started.

<I>D226-171 09-06-18</I> - <B>Bromeliads will be our companions.</B><xxx>

<BR>We see some of the plant life that will be common along the trail. The dry
brown grass indicates the end of the growing season in these parts. Mid June
is midwinter.
<BR>

<I>D226-172 09-06-18</I> - <B>Farm terraces along Machu Picchu RR.</B><xxx>

<BR>Now we're fairly begun. Those terraces opposite might be of Inca origin. But
the farmers of today are more inclined to the type of tillage you see in the
field beside the river. This well-groomed plot awaits the coming planting
season. You can see signs of farm roads and paths on the hillside. Reminds me
of how much you can discover back home in a photo that you didn't see at the
time you took it.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-173.jpeg">
<I>D226-173 09-06-18</I> - <B>Mt. Veronica follows us.</B><xxx>

<BR>The surrounding mountains become our companions. Giant rocks beside the trail
gives us the feeling of being planted firmly on the bosom of Mother Earth.

<BR>And impressive bosoms they are too, judging from those crags on the other
side of the river. We're into some serious mountain country now. Agriculture
is confined between high valley walls.

<I>D226-175 09-06-18</I> - <B>Our guide, Angelo.</B><xxx>

<BR>Angelo, our guide, introduces himself. Here he's expounding on safety
procedures, not getting lost, and the general context of our excursion. We
thought him a bit glib at first, but we soon come to like him a great deal.
His english is quite fluent.

<I>D226-176 09-06-18</I> - <B>Residences along the trail.</B><xxx>

<BR>The trail at this point isn't exactly wilderness. We find several lodges like
this soliciting tourists along the way. It's uncertain how you would contact
the proprietors to make a reservation, but a place like this would do nicely
for a few lazy days of downtime or recuperation.

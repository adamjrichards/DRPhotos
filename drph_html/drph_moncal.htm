<BR>Monitor calibration
<BR>07-02-07: Another attempt at monitor calibration on <I></I>NED: Hdw
flat, ie. Samsung synchmaster 225bw set at brightness 100,
contrast 100. ATI interface: gamma 1.1, brightness 10, contrast
50.  This agrees with calibration charts. See bookmarked
websites. 07-02-08: redid with g=1.0. Note that "contrast" on
the hardware and ATI interfaces is really brightness or
whitepoint, "brightness" is really black level or blackpoint.
This seems to clarify things, the main thing to do is to set
black and white-points of the monitor to correspond with the
image's black 0,0,0 and white 255,255,255 levels. Gradations
should be visible at both ends. Updated this note: 08-03-03.
<BR>Use this to check aspect ratio on attached screens.

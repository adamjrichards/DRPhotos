<BR>
<BR>A collection of photographs, digitally edited and
printed. An attempt to apply some of the techniques of
the water-colour artist to photographic print-making: in
particular, an enhanced ability to pick out significant
detail against a background of blended colour.
<BR>
<BR>The affinity between water-colour paintings and
traditional photographic prints begins with water,
pigment and paper. Both media have long been used by
those who favour portability, rapid execution and direct
observational rapport with fleeting subject matter.
Watercolour painters and photographers have very often
regarded themselves as documentarists or empiricists,
with their role as artists, being mainly to interpret an
objective rather than an internal truth.
<BR>
<BR>This modest parallelism between water-colour art and
photography has lately shown signs of a significant
convergence. With the recent advent of the digital
darkroom, photographic print-making in colour has now
become a reality, not only for well-funded
professionals, but for the serious amateur.
<BR>
<BR>Pigment blending techniques and brushwork, similar to
those used by the water-colour artist, can now be
simulated in the computer. This is a tribute, first of
all, to the natural genius of water-colour as an imaging
medium. Colours can be made to blend transparently, to
flow, to diffuse, to gather, and yet, when desired, to
have the well-defined edges of a line drawing.  It is
not merely a technological trick that the computer
can help the photo artist create similar effects. 
<BR>
<BR>Both media are inherently competent at supporting what
are essentially image-interpreting, in contrast to
image-inventing, effects. Both achieve a characteristic
and, at times, an uncannily similar result. However, a
viable raw image must first be present. Art is not
created by the machine any more than paintings are
spontaneously created by water, pigment and paper. The
physical behaviour of the imaging tools, while
supportive, serves only to project onto a finished work
the result of an artist's particular selection and
handling of available elements: the digital lenses,
brushes, filters, collage and colourization tools, and
most importantly, the original image.
<BR>
<BR>The richness and freedom of these techniques in the
photo artist's new toolbox at last gives me hope that
photography can continue to romance the world of direct
experience, while at the same time developing the
selective eye of the artist who knows, so much better
than the unaided camera, the difference between figure
and ground.Landscapes and ScenicsHouse and GardenPeopleThrough a Glass, Digitally             D. Richards

<BR>Desiderata: *, more essential items: **
<BR>
<BR>Photogaphy
<BR> ** 8+mp front camera + rear camera
<BR> ** note-taking app, via voice, stylus, or virt.keybd. preferably integrated
with photo app. Need to tie notes easily to individual pics.
<BR> * stylus capability for note-taking could be an asset, but voice or
virt.keybd would probably suffice.
<BR> ** bright screen for photos in sunlight conditions
<BR> ** macro photo capability
<BR> * anti-shake feature
<BR> * low-light capability
<BR> ** direct radio communication with tablet, laptop. not via phone.
<BR> * Geo-tagging of photos
<BR> * HD video, 1080p
<BR> * Zoom feature, modest telephoto, wide-angle
<BR> * specialty photo features less important. I PhotoShop everything.
<BR>
<BR>Phone-specific
<BR> ** pocketable size and build, rules out small tablet
<BR> * adequate processor and internal memory
<BR> * micro-sd, sim card slots
<BR> * removeable battery
<BR> ** the usual phone options. Use phone chiefly for emergency or last minute
issues, family coordination.
<BR> ** basic internet browsing, weather, google, email
<BR> ** wi-fi base station cabability for use with tablet or laptop
<BR> ** near-range radio communication with laptop or tablet for file exchange via
wi-fi or bluetooth link. see previous.
<BR> * GSM, map app 
<BR> * saw impressive translation app on HTC phone in China
<BR> ** durable enough to keep in pocket or purse
<BR> * no contract pricing available
<BR> * inductive charging
<BR> ** all-day, off-and-on use without recharge. ex. videos not an essential
<BR> * ability to run windows apps interesting, but not essential. Note-taking
issue is more important and could be available on Android or other platforms.
<BR> Saw Nokia Lumia 920 review in PC Magazine. Reputedly has good camera.

<BR>inductive charging. HD video. Hi-res cam. Windows8. Anti-shake. Note
feature or app, voice or screen input? price, telus noterm $250. GSM. heavy.
1280x768.
<P><A href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=samsung galaxy note II review"> websrch:samsung galaxy note II review</A>

<BR>Has note-on-back-of-photo feature. 8Mp camera. $300, 3yr.
The above write-on feature may not have any practical transfer to PC.
Almost useless if notes have to be retyped. Ideally, notes should go into
JPG description field and be integrated with the image file and recoverable
later by other applications. May have to test this at camera stores.

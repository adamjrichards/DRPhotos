<BR>High-altitude trekking
<P><B>_/  {#}
<BR>    When I was a lttle shaver my dad wangled me a visit to the cab of a steam
locomotive standing in the CNR station of Richmond Quebec. We were on our way
from Montreal to Danville. I was mightily impressed by all the pipes and
gauges, the hissing steam. The fireman opened the firebox door and heaved in
a shovelful of coal, producing a blast of heat and a cloud of sparks. I was
instantly converted and wanted to become an engine driver. Shortly after
this, the steam engine was replaced by the boring diesel on most of Canada's
railroads.
<BR>   In elementary and high school I was introduced to the history of various
Imperial heroes and explorers: Clive of India, Captain Cook, Burton, Speke. I
decided to become an explorer. Or, perhaps, more practically, an Imperial
civil servant such as the District Commissioner of some salubrious Pacific
Island inhabited by hospitable ladies in grass skirts. 
<BR>   Not long after the war came the announcement that the Hunt expedition,
with Hilary and Tenzing, had climbed Everest, the planet's highest mountain.
Despite the heralding of a New Elizabethan Age, the Empire began an
inexorable contraction and the oportunities for Imperial Civil Servants, even
those well-versed in Urdu or Fijian, began to dry up.
<BR>   Furthermore, with the "conquering" of the last geographical challenges,
the age of exploration began a gradual slide into celebrity stunts and
endurance feats. Witness "The man who skied down Mt. Everest". The only
viable alternatives seemed to be scientific bean-counting or National
Geographic Specials. 
<BR>   Then came about 4 decades of university, parenthood and employment. And
now, today, as a superannuated computer programmer, grandparent and decrepit
senior citizen, the opportunities for the life of an explorer are few indeed.
So what is a person to do who long ago conceived of the meaning of life in
terms of fire-breathing engines or malaria-infested swamps?
<BR>   The answer may lie in a step sideways. The real essence of exploration
lies in the structure of the experience rather than in the details. Discovery
is not just a matter of braving geographical hazards or enumerating
topographical facts, but of putting together separate experiences into a
comprehensive idea. Creating a "gestalt", if you will, of details that form
part of a newly revealed unity. And this is what I would like to convey to
the viewers of these pictures. How a high-level view of even familiar terrain
can be, not only a new and joyful experience, but also serve as a metaphor
for awakening experiences of other sorts as well.

<BR> * A collection of travel pics from
<BR>   a lifetime of hiking.
<BR> * An attempt to convey some sense
<BR>   of what a macroscopic experience
<BR>   hiking high (and wide) can be.
<BR> * (For those crazy enough to try it.)
<BR>My first "mountain"-climbing expedition, was probably in 1946 or 1947. The
Shipton Township Pinnacle is located in the Eastern Townships of Quebec. One
of the outlying hills of the Appalachian chain. I had high boots and a rope.
The experience seemed ecstatic at the time. But when we got down, our car had
sunk into a muddy ditch and we had to get a farmer to pull it out with his
tractor for $15.

<BR> * End of Show
<BR> * Thanks for your attention.
<BR> * No hikers were permanently harmed
<BR>   to get these pictures.
<BR> * Yes, we would do it again,

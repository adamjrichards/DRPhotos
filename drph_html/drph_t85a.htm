<I>t85a-00 85-08-27</I> - <B>Silver Anniversary Canoe Trip, 1985</B><xxx>

<BR>    In August, 1985, Merle and I paddle from George Lake to Baie
Fine, round the coast to Killarney village and back again to
Killarney Provincial Park.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-01a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-01a 85-08-27</I> - <B>George Lake - looking west.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Our first morning on the water, paddling conditions are
ideal. Here we're looking west on George Lake back toward the
starting point. The hills on either side have been the scene of
many hikes and climbs on former vacation trips.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-01b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-01b 85-08-27</I> - <B>George Lake - Freeland L. portage.</B><xxx>

<BR>    At the east end of George Lake is the first portage into
Freeland Lake. We're still looking westward toward George Lake,
back the way we've just come.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-02a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-02a 85-08-27</I> - <B>Freeland Lake - water lilies.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Freeland Lake is a paradise of water lilies. Oh to cruise
along in these cool depths like some glistening trout and see
how the flowers look from beneath the water surface.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-02b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-02b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Furious paddling in the teeth of a brisk wind brings us to
campsite 29 on O.S.A. Lake. We first climbed those white rocks
over on the shore back in 1977.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-03a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-03a 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Our own island with not a soul in sight -- sheltered by pine
trees and surrounded by blue water. Or is that a speck of red
nylon, over in those trees on the left, near the tip of that other
island?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-03b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-03b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    More cliffs on the north side of the Lake. Nathan
and I climbed these back in '77. At the top we found a stream
flowing over the rocks and in the damp soil nearby a fine
collection of mushrooms and fungi.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-04a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-04a 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake - Merle on mat.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The first thing the canoist needs after battling the wind is
a rest. We lie on sleeping mats and inhale the scent of pine
needles. As usual, the neighbourhood chipmunk nags us to get
lunch ready.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-04b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-04b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake - Merle launches our canoe.</B><xxx>

<BR>    By midafternoon, after a bite to eat, energy reserves are
brimming again and those hills on the south side of the lake are
calling.  We paddle across and pull up the canoe on a handy log.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-05a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-05a 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake - Derek and view.</B><xxx>

<BR>    A hike through the pine trees along the shore and a scramble
up the cliff takes us to this vantage point. That's <U>our</U> island
down there with the tent hidden in the trees near the tip. Its a
good place to sit and fantasize about being ruler of the lake.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-05b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-05b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake - view.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Nearing the top, polished slabs of quartzite -- nearly sheer
in places -- invite risk-taking. The pleasure of clambering on
these smooth, clean ledges takes hold.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-06a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-06a 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake - Merle climbing.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Try and hook your chin up over the edge, Merle.
<BR>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-06b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-06b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The sight of blue water dotted with islands and surrounded
by rocky hills confirms O.S.A. Lake as one of the province's
great beauty spots. You are now standing on the very top of the
cliff and looking toward the west end of the lake. In 1977 we
camped on that last island just off the left bank.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-07a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-07a 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The eye sweeps round to the right. Looking north, you can
see today's island campsite again, this time from a higher
altitude.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-07b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-07b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Turning toward the east end of the lake, you might be able
to catch a glimpse of Killarney Lake in the far distance.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-08a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-08a 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The neck of land between Killarney Lake and O.S.A. Lake has
a fairly level path.  Altogether, 3 easy portages join George
Lake to O.S.A. Lake -- a morning's trip from the park's boat
dock.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-08b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-08b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    These are the white cliffs that were visible from our island
campsite below. We climbed them with Nathan and Miriam back in
'77.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-09a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-09a 85-08-27</I> - <B>Teardrop Lake.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Stumbling through the woods back of the lookout, we finally
locate Teardrop Lake.  On the far side, a low spot in the margin
of trees marks the point where it drains down into O.S.A. Lake.
It was here that the beauteous Mrs. Maidstone seduced young
James Fielding in my novel, <U>The Scarlet Thread</U>. The fictional
pond is a composite of this location and Heaven Lake, further
east in the park.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-09b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-09b 85-08-27</I> - <B>Teardrop Lake - Merle resting.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Here's the beauteous Mrs. M. now, resting after her
exertions. The camera is held by Ensign James Fielding of the
49th Regiment of Foot. Bet you didn't know they had colour
photography back in 1816?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-10a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-10a 85-08-27</I> - <B>Teardrop Lake - red leaves.</B><xxx>

<BR>    On the way back down to the canoe, a sign of approaching
autumn makes us think of September.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-10b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-10b 85-08-27</I> - <B>O.S.A. Lake - Merle and moonrise.</B><xxx>

<BR>    That evening we explore every inch of our island campsite
and then sit watching the moon rise over familiar scenes.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-11a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-11a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Muriel Lake - osprey nest.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The next day, the portage westward into Muriel Lake lead us
to an osprey sitting on her nest. No sign of young ones. Her
mate appears briefly, circles the nest and flies off.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-11b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-11b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Muriel Lake - water weeds.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The channel is almost choked with water weeds. This could be
some jungle river full of water hyacinths.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-12a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-12a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Muriel Lake - beaver lodge.</B><xxx>

<BR>    A beaver lodge with a lookout tree -- for a beaver with
climbing ability. A few peeled sticks in the water suggest there
may be a family in residence.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-12b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-12b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Artist Lake - beaver dam.</B><xxx>

<BR>    This huge beaver dam keeps up the level of Artist Lake. It's
about 5 feet high with a continuous spill of water coming over
the edge in wet weather. You have to lower the canoe from the
top level down into the creek below without either damaging the
beavers' engineering works or flipping the canoe and spilling
the cargo.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-13a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-13a 85-08-28</I> - <B>The Pool - the yacht Chanticleer.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The chain of lakes and ponds in the outflow of O.S.A. Lake
eventually leads to The Pool, an easterly extension of Baie Fine
which is also connected to Georgian Bay. The yacht Chanticleer
has come all the way from Florida.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-13b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-13b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - Campsite.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We paddle down the bay to a peninsula on the south side. As
usual, our campsite is a work of art with striped rocks and
heroic scenery.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-14a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-14a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - Merle in tent.</B><xxx>

but a little mousie.

<I>t85a-15a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - tufts of grass.</B><xxx>

<BR>    All around the campsite, rocks bake in the heat.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-15b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-15b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - tufts of grass.</B><xxx>

<BR>    While strolling near the tent, these tufts of grass appear
to suggest a route.
<BR>

<I>t85a-16a 85-08-26</I> - <B>Baie Fine - tuft of grass.</B><xxx>

going on down there?

<I>t85a-16b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - silhouetted grass.</B><xxx>

<BR>    You might even want to lie down and peer curiously between
the grass stems, like some campsite chipmunk ...
<BR>

<I>t85a-17a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - grasses & rocks.</B><xxx>

<I>t85a-17b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - backlit grasses.</B><xxx>

<BR>    The grass is everywhere -- a jungle of rustling bamboo.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-18a.jpeg">
<I>t85a-18a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - tuft of grass against water.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Out in the open again, you scamper toward the bay ...

<I>t85a-19a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - puddle in groove.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Wetting your whiskers in this pool, you would probably
conclude, as I did, that a 48 year old, 165 pound chipmunk is
not built to run around on all fours. It's time to get the fire
started and put the kettle on.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/t85a/t85a-19b.jpeg">
<I>t85a-19b 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - Merle by campfire.</B><xxx>

<BR>    At sundown we sit and stare into the flames. A yacht bearing
a mysterious stranger lies anchored in the cove on the far side.

<I>t85a-20a 85-08-28</I> - <B>Baie Fine - canoe and sunset.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Our own yacht, a 17-foot Grumman aluminum canoe -- veteran
of many encounters with rocks, submerged timbers and iron spikes
left over from the days of logging -- waits for more of the same
treatment tomorrow.

<I>t85a-20b 85-08-30</I> - <B>Fraser Bay - Turtle Creek.</B><xxx>

<BR>    After a day of rain and a wet night on a beach at the mouth
of Baie Fine, we set off in better weather down Fraser Bay. Here
we dry out clothes at a place we call Turtle Creek. It offers a
sheltered harbour for the canoe, a creek with a turtle in it,
and a lovely campsite. A perfect place to stay, but it's only
noon.

<BR>    It feels like something is watching from concealment. When you
meditate long enough in a place like this, rocks and old tree
roots begin to take on a portentous quality, to seem haunted by
spirits. You stare and stare until finally you begin to see into
a thing, and through it ...

<BR>    Leaving town, we enter Georgian Bay opposite the Killarney
lighthouse. The waves are high, making for a splashy trip ahead
of us. But part of the way, a screen of small island protects
canoists from the full force of the open water.

<BR>    We leave our million-dollar island early next morning. It's
on the edge of Killarney Park and within half-an-hour of the
parking lot at the boat-launching ramp. We've been out 5 days,
paddled a modest 68 kilometres, and hauled our canoe over 10
portages. The weather has an autumnal look; we head for home.

<BR>   1981 Pukasaw Hike  <)))
<BR><P><B>Vacation 81 - Pukaskwa National Park.</B>
<BR>     In August, 1981, Merle and I go on a hike to Pukaskwa
National Park conducted by Nature Canada. The description in the
advertisment says intriguing things about "the overwhelming
presence of the inland sea." So we pay $290.00 each for two
tickets to seventh heaven (Group of Seven heaven, that is), pack
our camping gear and head north through Parry sound, Sudbury and
Sault St. Marie. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-29.jpeg">
<I>0205-29 81-08-22</I> - <B>Superior shoreline.</B><xxx>

<BR>     North of Sault Ste. Marie the heroic quality of the
landscape is a real surprise. Someone used to looking at parking
lots and highrise apartments everyday is apt to come unstuck
with the spaciousness of it all.
<BR>     And by the way, the first two clips in the synchro-sound show were
re-recorded in 2006 to improve sound quality. Those that follow were recorded
in late '81 or early '82, about 25 years earlier. So this is an excercise in
audio as well as photo archaelogy. See T81A.AVI or T81A.MP4 for the movie
version of this show with sound.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0228/0228-29.jpeg">
<I>0228-29 </I> - <B>Lake Superior shoreline.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Here we see for our first time as Ontario residents,
stunning views of a long coastline. The background hills rise
from blue water and stretch onward to the limit of visibility. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0228/0228-33.jpeg">
<I>0228-33 </I> - <B>Beach at Pancake Bay.</B><xxx>

<BR>     In the days of the fur trade, eastbound voyageurs would
stop here on their last night before reaching Sault Ste. Marie.
By this time food would be running low and they'd be reduced to
eating pancakes, so they named this Pancake Bay.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-30.jpeg">
<I>0205-30 81-08-22</I> - <B>Wawa Goose.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Watching over the road to Marathon, the Wawa Goose is the
patron saint of northbound travellers. Frankie Lane had a hit
song, years ago, with the line: "I must go where the wild goose
goes ..."  We take the hint and go.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0218/0218-01.jpeg">
<I>0218-01 </I> - <B>Marathon, view of pulp mill.</B><xxx>

<BR>     The pulp mill at Marathon: That mountain in the background
was a landmark to travellers sailing or paddling along the coast
in the days of the fur trade. The town and mill lie on the shore
of Lake Superior, off a side-road from the Trans-Canada Highway.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0218/0218-02.jpeg">
<I>0218-02 </I> - <B>Marathon, pile of pulp logs.</B><xxx>

<BR>     To the traveller of today, the piles of pulp logs and the
smell of sulphur are more likely to be the landmark. Heron Bay,
just a few miles east of Marathon on the Trans-Canada Highway,
is our rendezvous point with the Pukasaw hiking group. But we
decide to go on a bit further to find a park with a good beach
to spend the night.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-31.jpeg">
<I>0205-31 81-08-22</I> - <B>Merle on beach, Neys P.P..</B><xxx>

<BR>     Neys Provincial Park is about 20 miles west of Marathon. We
camp here our last night on the road before leaving on the hike.
It's worth the few extra miles of driving. The long sandy beach
has picturesque, half-buried piles of logs. Everything is
conveniently set up to help the novice layabout brush up on
beachcombing skills. Your first assignment is to recline
horizontally, head pillowed on a piece of driftwood, while you
concentrate on the finer things of life. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-32.jpeg">
<I>0205-32 81-08-22</I> - <B>Merle and red flowers, Neys P.P..</B><xxx>

<BR>     See how easy it is to get carried away -- to a tropic land
of brilliant flowers and gorgeous sunsets? 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-33.jpeg">
<I>0205-33 81-08-23</I> - <B>Heron Bay wharf.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Next morning, we go down early to the Heron Bay wharf and
stroll around inspecting the local merchant marine. This pier is
at the mouth of the Pic River. The tugboats exist mainly for the
purpose of towing log booms from the mouth of the river to the
mill at Marathon, a short distance up the coast. Our
transportation to the starting point of the hike is that luxury
liner down at the far end.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-34.jpeg">
<I>0205-34 81-08-23</I> - <B>Merle on boomlogs, Heron Bay.</B><xxx>

<BR>     While we wait for the group to assemble, we take turns
impersonating dockside riff-raff. This character is a pretty
unconvincing example. Someone told us these boom logs actually
came from the west coast. The local trees, supposedly, never
grew this big, even in the early days of lumbering. The giant
timbers are chained end-to-end to form a floating barrier which
will keep the pulp logs together while being towed across the
open water of Lake Superior to the mill in Marathon.  After
loading the tugboat with backpacks, we begin a rough trip of
several hours down the coast. To me the sky looks ominous.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-35.jpeg">
<I>0205-35 81-08-23</I> - <B>Merle in launch, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Arriving at Fisherman's Cove, we enter a narrow sound and
heave-to. The tugboat's launch, which has been towing in the
wake, is hauled alongside and loaded with backpacks and hikers. 
At the tiller is Captain McCuaig, owner of the tugboat. In front
of him, some Shanghai-ed passengers soon to be marooned on
shore.  In two trips, everything, including 10 hikers and all
their gear, is ferried ashore and dumped on the beach while our
troopship waits in deeper water. Then Captain McCuaig heads back
to Heron Bay, abandoning us to our fate.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-36.jpeg">
<I>0205-36 81-08-23</I> - <B>The NatCan hikers, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     The setting has a magic resonance. The sun has just
penetrated the coastal mists revealing an unexpected harbour,
hidden from passing ships by steep cliffs. We stumble ashore on
wobbly sea-legs and then, joyfully, the noise and fumes of the
tugboat are gone, replaced by instant tranquility. No other
signs of life except the gulls and we castaways. Behind the
trackless sand lies a dense wall of forest. We might be
explorers, colonists, a party of marines come to quell the
locals, or transported convicts, for that matter. I suspect that
one of us, was all these things rolled into one. ... Did I say
the sand was trackless? Well it was, when we first set foot on
shore. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0205/0205-37.jpeg">
<I>0205-37 81-08-23</I> - <B>Merle and birchtree.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Merle is thankful to abandon her sailor's life on the
bounding main. Here at last is something solid to cling to and
relief from the rolling and pitching of the open water. On our
first night out, we camp in the woods at this very spot. We have
to, we've taken the wrong direction and walked south for about 4
hours until the mistake is finally admitted by our leaders.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-07.jpeg">
<I>0206-07 </I> - <B>Reindeer moss.</B><xxx>

<BR>     We're exhausted and make camp in the woods about a quarter
mile from the nearest water. After tapping into the emergency
supply of wine to keep up morale, we sink into beds of reindeer
moss like this.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-01.jpeg">
<I>0206-01 81-08-24</I> - <B>The group, hiking north.</B><xxx>

<BR>     The next day we retrace our steps back to the point of
disembarcation. The mistake is worth it, because it means
spending more time at Fisherman's Cove. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-02.jpeg">
<I>0206-02 81-08-24</I> - <B>Merle swimming, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Of all the things we enjoy, the best is swimming from
deserted sandy beaches. Though the water is icy, days of hot sun
and sweat of the trail drive us into the waves at the slightest
excuse. And later we sit on the beach to dry off and think deep
thoughts about pine trees, rocks, water, sand and sun. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-14.jpeg">
<I>0206-14 </I> - <B>Silver tree root.</B><xxx>

<BR>     This tree root must once have had a tenacious grip on some
rocky ledge. Imagine it whirling round and boring it's way into
the sand like a corkscrew.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-06.jpeg">
<I>0206-06 81-08-24</I> - <B>Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Fisherman's cove has two beaches, separated by a peninsula.
This is the southern one -- we decide put up our tents on the
northern side where the trail comes down to the water.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-05.jpeg">
<I>0206-05 81-08-24</I> - <B>Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     With nothing to do for the rest of the afternoon, some of
us climb up the cliff that walls-in the north side of the beach.
Strenuous hallooing by the climbers at the top is audible below,
because somebody comes out of a tent and thumbs her nose at the
show-offs up on the heights.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-04.jpeg">
<I>0206-04 81-08-24</I> - <B>Scott Wilson, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Rebuffed, we take to meditating on the splendid view to the
south. This is Scott Wilson of Parks Canada who is accompanying
us part way.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-03.jpeg">
<I>0206-03 81-08-24</I> - <B>Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     From the extreme end of the headland that protects
Fisherman's cove, you can see both beaches at the same time. The
camp is located on that strip of sand at the left. Our blue dome
tent is just visible on the beach.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-08.jpeg">
<I>0206-08 81-08-24</I> - <B>Beach campsite, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>    This is our portable village and movable main street. That's our tent at
the left.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-09.jpeg">
<I>0206-09 81-08-24</I> - <B>Merle, Scott, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Round the firepit, some of the hikers work up their acts
for this evening's campfire-cabaret. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-10.jpeg">
<I>0206-10 81-08-24</I> - <B>Kevin clowning, Fisherman's Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Our leader, Kevin O'Donnel, practices his comic
"Drop-the-Pants" routine. The women keep calling for encores. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-21.jpeg">
<I>0206-21 81-08-25</I> - <B>Merle, blueberrying.</B><xxx>

<BR>     The next day we set off north on the trail to Oiseau Bay.
Looking back toward Fisherman's Cove, I catch Merle in the act
of lagging beind to eat wild blueberries and stop to join her.
... The view is typical of the coastal portions of the trail: an
alternation of rocky headlands and sheltered coves. We're
tempted to clamber down for a swim, but we have to keep up with
the others. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-20.jpeg">
<I>0206-20 81-08-25</I> - <B>The Group, a thin line.</B><xxx>

<BR>     The group presses onward, a thin line of explorers plodding
into the unknown.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-18.jpeg">
<I>0206-18 81-08-25</I> - <B>Shoreline view.</B><xxx>

<BR>     We pass this unknown bay containing several nameless
islands. Someone wonders if we could cross over by going down to
the end of the point, wading part way out, and then floating the
packs across the deep water on a log.  No reason at all to go
out there. You would simply arrive on another rocky shore and be
left looking back at your original starting point. But the
futility of the project doesn't in the least take away from the
urge to explore uninhabited islands. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-22.jpeg">
<I>0206-22 81-08-25</I> - <B>Shoreline view.</B><xxx>

<BR>     We descend from the top of the cliffs to the beach at
Oiseau Bay. When climbing uphill, the group tends to string out
when everybody goes into low gear. Going downill, as you can see
here, the opposite happens. We coast along in neutral and the
group bunches up and walks on each other's heels.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-24.jpeg">
<I>0206-24 81-08-26</I> - <B>Troll-bridge.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Parks Canada has done its best to provide a good
environment for the local wildlife. Since this bridge has very
little water under it, we judge it a cosy habitat for the Lesser
Pukasaw Troll. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-23.jpeg">
<I>0206-23 81-08-26</I> - <B>Suspension bridge.</B><xxx>

<BR>     But this one, which we use to cross the White River just to
the north of the Oiseau Bay campsite, stirkes us as a bit too
luxurious even for the most pampered hikers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-33.jpeg">
<I>0206-33 81-08-27</I> - <B>Suspension bridge, Willow River.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Over the Willow River, we find a more spartan structure,
with wire netting along both sides to keep hikers from falling
off the tightrope into the water. None of these streams would be
impossible to wade in August, but deep water might hold us up in
the spring.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-25.jpeg">
<I>0206-25 81-08-26</I> - <B>Trail.</B><xxx>

<BR>     We have constant surprises along the trail. One day we're
heading down to the shore through this cleft in the rocks. It's
been a hot tramp over the sun-baked cliffs and what do you
think a pack of tired hikers will do for rest and recreation? 
More rock-hopping, naturally.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-26.jpeg">
<I>0206-26 81-08-26</I> - <B>Bouldering.</B><xxx>

<BR>     This twenty foot precipice provides challenges for the most
adventurous bouldering enthusiasts. A few of us simply rest up
on the rocks below and encourage the others. That's Merle in
the dark shirt going strong for the top.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-17.jpeg">
<I>0206-17 </I> - <B>Rockscape with white flowers.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Mind, you don't fall down into the canyon, Merle. That
hydrangea bush in the middle looks like it's a long way down.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-27.jpeg">
<I>0206-27 81-08-26</I> - <B>Shoreline view.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Of course, if you only want to soothe tired feet, there
is always the clear, cold water of Lake Superior ...

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-29.jpeg">
<I>0206-29 81-08-26</I> - <B>Trail.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Back on the trail again, we walk through an enchanted
forest. The earth is carpeted with low, ground-hugging bushes
and reindeer moss so tidy, it looks like a garden. But there's
no sign of the gardener. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-30.jpeg">
<I>0206-30 81-08-26</I> - <B>Maggie, abandoned cabin.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Perhaps this is the ruin of the gardener's cabin,
conveniently located beside the trail. Maggie, our alternate
hike leader, suggests that this piece of real-estate should
appear in the advertisment as a "handy-man special".
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-32.jpeg">
<I>0206-32 81-08-27</I> - <B>Pukaskwa Pit area.</B><xxx>

<BR>     At Shotwatch Cove, the trail crosses a field of rocks
the size of bowling balls. Their uniformity is peculiar enough,
but there's more to see ...
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-31.jpeg">
<I>0206-31 81-08-27</I> - <B>Pukasaw Pit, Shotwatch Cove.</B><xxx>

<BR>     We soon locate several Pukasaw Pits, unexplained conical
depressions among the rocks. Merle is sitting about three feet
down in this one. No one seems to be positive about their
origin.  Probably left by the local Indians long ago. Looking
on, second from the left and far right, are two south-bound
hikers we meet on the trail.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0206/0206-34.jpeg">
<I>0206-34 81-08-27</I> - <B>Beach scene.</B><xxx>

all end?  Don't those clouds seem at least a <U>little</U> ominous?
No, eh?

<I>0206-36 81-08-27</I> - <B>Derek beachcombing.</B><xxx>

<BR>     With an hour to spare before dinner, I lie on the beach
working up a course of studies for an advanced beachcoming
seminar this fall. I've already assembled a few of the required
study aids: a good text book, a sandy beach and a log to rest
the head while seeking spiritual guidance.  How to get all these
study aids back to Toronto, that's the problem.

academy of higher beachcombing. Poor thing. Shanghaied by a tugboat captain,
abandoned at Fisherman's Cove, route-marched by fanatic hikers up the coast
and, finally, stuck on a beach in the middle of nowhere. What a fate.

anyone gets rained out and has to come creeping back to Kevin and Maggie for
comfort.

<BR>     I too have an urge to witness the exact moment of impact.
An energetic sprint down the beach gets me there to watch the
sun plop beneath the waves. The vapour trail is courtesy of CP
flight number 81, cruising at 37,000 feet, non-stop from
Vancouver and now only 45 minutes from landing at Toronto.
Somehow, the rat race seems much further away than that.

<BR>     Next day we cross the height of land to the valley of the
White River. Here the trail meanders inland across high and dry
ridges, then passes through stands of birch, already showing
autumn colours.  A premonition of winter sends a chill through
my wanderer's heart -- the end of summer, the end of our
vacation, the end of freedom for another year.

<BR>     But soon we descend into damper, more summery climes,
reaching Upper Chigamiwinigum Falls on the White River. Getting
across at this point would be impossible without a bridge or a
long detour upstream. Kevin is dashing over the rocks to find
the foamiest part of the falls to refill his canteen.

<BR>     At middle Chigamiwinigum Falls, we find a perfect spot.
Merle and I put up our blue dome tent on a sand bank that would
be inundated at high water in the springtime. Behind the tent is
a sand hill that would be an island. Close by, in a wet place
behind the tent, enormous moose tracks, big as dinner plates,
and wolf prints as well. As an rank amateur in the wildlife
field, I sincerely hope we don't get stepped on in the dark by a
near-sighted ungulate fleeing from canis lupus rampant.

<BR>     We enter an area swept by mist, where conversation is
impossible and the presence of surging power inescapable.

<BR>     I step back to get a more scenic view of Merle. On the
slab beside her, is a shallow depression which looks like the
imprint of a giant's back. Perhaps it's a couch for the guardian
spirits of the place, or perhaps ...

<I>0207-16 81-08-28</I> - <B>Merle, M.C. Falls.</B><xxx>

<BR>     To me this looks a resonant spot to celebrate the rites of
spring, with the accompanyment of raging water, the occasional
eagle scream from high above.  But, unfortunately, it's a little
late in the season and, anyway, we're in a direct line-of-sight
from camp.

<BR>     Another truly inspired, but impractical, idea has to be
filed away for more research and development. That rocky
altar might be cold and damp but <U>think</U> of the sanctity of
it.

<I>0207-21 81-08-28</I> - <B>Merle, crawfish shell.</B><xxx>

<BR>     On the way back to the campsite, we find a cast-off
crayfish shell, bright purple -- a consolation for innocence
retained.

<BR>     The next morning we go over our last and most exciting
susension bridge. This is the only way to get across the the
river we've been camped beside. Merle skips out to the middle
and begins to bounce up and down, testing the resilience of
steel cable.

<I>0207-11 82-08-28</I> - <B>Group, M.C. Falls.</B><xxx>

<BR>     Here's the entire group assembled at the falls -- a
never-to-be-repeated sight.  Our leaders are in the back row:
Kevin is wearing the green hat; Maggie is on the right. ... We
arrive at the highway leading to the national park campsite at
noon. Hitching rides back to the Heron Bay docks where we've
parked our cars, we prepare to go our separate ways.  Meeting
civilization again is a shock: video games, cash registers,
highway traffic ... As we come out of the roadside eatery where
we have a final meal together, it begins to rain. The deluge is
so severe we have to pull off the road and wait it out. See?
didn't I tell you all along it looked like bad weather ahead?

<BR>     But we've forgotten something. Isn't that one of our group out there,
still sitting on a rock overlooking Lake Superior and watching the sun go
down ...

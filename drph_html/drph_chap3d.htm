<P>    Paddling resolutely, James entered a creek at the far end of
the inlet. He began to ascend a narrow stream, stopping often to
hoist the canoe over beaver dams and obstructions that divided
the channel into a series of ascending locks. Then he stopped to
listen for signs of activity from the vicinity of the schooner,
now anchored some quarter mile behind him, concealed behind the
coastal rocks.
<P>    A new thought struck him as the distance between him and the
schooner increased his sense of security. This might actually be
a fresh opportunity as well as an unexpected coincidence. He
could put his powers of observation to the test, dabble a bit on
the darker side of staff work, as Harris would have put it. Only
this time, he wouldn't get caught.
<P>    He pivoted the canoe inshore, pulled it up the overgrown
bank into concealment, and then began to search for a
comfortable eminence where he could wait till dusk without being
seen by foragers from the ship, or being gobbled alive by
mosquitoes.
<P>    
<P>    With the sunset fading on the horizon, he launched the canoe
and made off downriver the way he'd come. Just sufficient light
remained to allow navigation in the narrow channel, choked by
obstructions and water plants. As the mouth of the creek widened
into the bay, he veered right, keeping the canoe within arm's
reach of the steep shoreline. The rocks still felt warm to the
touch. He remembered the previous night back at Landry's Bay
when he'd met Mrs. Maidstone sitting atop a rock in the woods.
Those warm surfaces had been a preview of the warm flesh of her
calves and thighs.
<P>    The schooner loomed ahead. James allowed the canoe to drift
forward at a snail's pace, occasionally nudging the rocky flank
of the coast. Hand over hand, with paddle outstretched to fend
off, he worked his way down the shore, hoping he wouldn't go
aground on a submerged shelf. The black hulk of the ship now lay
opposite, ports open and a few lanterns burning. 
<P>    A crewman, barely visible, tramped the opposite side of the
deck, then turned and gazed westward toward the mouth of the
inlet. From within the hull, came a hum of voices. James was now
opposite the waist of the ship, about thirty feet from her side.
He continued to edge past. Then his paddle banged on a gunwale.
The pacing crewman stopped, crossed the deck and stood peering
over at the shore. James leaned forward, face down. He hoped his
matted hair would conceal the outline of his head. Presently,
the crewman resumed pacing.
<P>    The sternlights were open and a growl and mutter of
conversation spilled out into the night. It was the drawling
banter of men cooped up too long with only each other and
whiskey for companions. James considered carefully. Here he was
again, as on that night in Sackets Harbor, risking disaster to
gratify his curiosity. Then, he'd been willing to brave capture
for some useless trophy. Now, he knew he had to be interested
only in military intelligence. Science versus amateurism. He
pressed on.
<P>    He wondered if Colonel Enright remembered anything about
him. Or had young 'Fieldpiece', as he suspected, already blended
into the general vagueness of past events. He felt the thrill of
being the invisible watcher. And this was further heightened by
the knowledge that his spying now had the sanction of higher
authority. Authority so high, that he could only guess at its
real identity. He drifted nearer, paddling without removing the
blade from the water. The moon had not yet risen and, in the
shadow of the <I>Progress</I>, black hull, dark water and rocky shore
blended into one. Now <I>James Fielding</I> would be the wild,
prowling creature; his prey, Colonel Enright and his secrets.
<P>    James kneeled in the bow of the canoe, reaching ahead to
avoid bumping the ship's hull. He could smell the pitchy reek of
caulking, tar and cordage. Then his hand contacted the slimy
lower planking. He drew the canoe parallel to the hull, handing
it aft till he floated beneath the overhang of the stern. Above
him voices muttered, rose in emphasis, dwindled. He could only
catch a word or two. Clearly, it was Enright and Cyrus, going on
about some delay, berating someone or something as an object of
ridicule.
<P>    Rising to a crouch, he placed his hands against the woodwork
below the aft cabin windows. At the same time, he shifted his
feet till they were placed symmetrically. Facing the bow of the
canoe, he lifted a foot to the middle of a thwart, praying it
wouldn't crack. He rose gradually, clutching the edge of the
sill overhead and keeping the canoe pressed in against the
ship's stern. Finally, he poked his nose around the corner of
the nearest window.
<P>    A bottle of dark green glass obscured the view. Then a hand
flew up toward his face, grasped the neck, and snatched it off
the sill revealing the interior.
<P>    "More hooch?" offered Cyrus. He handed the bottle to
Maidstone, who sat demurely at a table with a marked-up sheet of
paper in front of him. James ducked back into the shadows. He
might have guessed that the canoe brigade's layover was only a
pretext for a meeting like this. The bribe to the brigade leader
must have been substantial.
<P>    "No thank you," rejoined Maidstone with cool formality. "We
should get to the bottom of this right away, Enright."
<P>    "Yer the only one here who's got any oppertoonity to git to
the <I>bottom</I> of anythin'," said Cyrus, helping himself to a
bonus swig from the bottle, then filling his glass.
<P>    "Yeah, Maidstone," put in Enright, "how <I>is</I> the missus
keeping these days?" This was apparently some private joke at
Maidstone's expense, shared between Enright and Cyrus. "No sign
of any little Maidstones coming along?"
<P>    "The lady's health is excellent, gentlemen. Now, I believe
we have plans to review ..."
<P>    "You shore you don't need a little loo-bree-cation before we
begin? To kinda, loosen up yer re-viewin', know what I mean?"
Cyrus tossed back half his glass and smirked at Maidstone who
studiously ignored him. "Mebbe, mebbe even a little
con-fee-rence with the lady t'getcha straight on a few
pre-luminaries y'ain't properly worked out just yet."
<P>    Maidstone stared venomously at Cyrus while addressing
himself to Enright. "I am certainly <I>not</I> in the habit of
confiding every detail of my affairs to 'the missus' as you call
her, Enright. And the lady is <I>abundantly</I> capable of amusing
herself with chit-chat while we swelter down here discussing
matters of importance." He appeared to be taking considerable
pains tonight to distance business from personal matters.
<P>    Another face, which James hadn't at first spied in the
gloom, leaned forward into the lamplight from a corner seat. The
accent sounded southern.
<P>    "Somethin' tells me ah'm not needed in this council of woah.
So if you gen'lemen'll excuse me, ah do believe ah shall go on
deck and keep the deah lady amused with idle chit-chat till
y'all're done."
<P>    "Thank you, Captain Loomis," said Enright. "And will you
kindly eject someone from one of your cabins. Our two
lovebirds'll need a place to sleep tonight."
<P>    James drew back his head and shifted stiff fingers on the
sill. It was getting difficult to keep the canoe directly
underneath him. And now, even more confusion. <I>Mrs. Maidstone</I>
was apparently on board. Footsteps went out along a companionway
and up a stair. Then above him, Captain Loomis' voice gave a
courtly greeting and a feminine contralto answered.
<P>    The lady was actually seated on deck, not 20 feet away from
him. The Maidstones must have come aboard between the time he'd
first sighted the ship and his return under cover of darkness.
She laughed and said something to the Captain. Loomis,
apparently, was now sitting down beside her for a chat.
<P>    Voices rose again in the cabin and James was forced to pay
stricter attention.
<P>    "... From now on Maidstone you'd better earn some of that
money we're paying you."
<P>    "Look here, Enright, this is a question of national
security, not petty cash ..."
<P>    "Aw, let's git the fuck on with it," whined Cyrus, "or
pretty soon, ah'll be too pissed to sit up straight, let alone
try to figger out what you two macaronies 're talkin' 'bout."
<P>    "Very well, let me fill you in while you're still lucid: A
certain Major Snell on the Governor's Montreal staff was
pursuaded to cooperate. The Governor, it seems, owed the Major a
favour. At my suggestion, the Major steered him toward
appointing a ship captain named Ames to lead the British
expedition. The man's a sea-going schoolmaster with ambitions to
be a preacher. And the result has been closer to a backwoods
camp-meeting than a military expedition. Even the enlisted men
know it's all a sham."
<P>    "So, you figure we've got no real competition after all?"
<P>    "That's it. Originally, Snell himself was supposed to go
along on the pretext of inspecting the fort on Drummond Island.
He would have provided strong leadership. But with a fair chunk
of cash, I was able to pursuade him to pull out at the last
minute. By then it was too late to find any substitute leader."
<P>    "Who's this Ames fella, anyhow?"
<P>    "Just another washed-up Royal Navy captain putting in time
till his pension comes due. Apparently, the man made a modest
reputation for himself on an Arctic expedition about twenty
years ago. He's supposed to have a talent for sanitation, diet
and morale. Second only to Captain Cook in keeping down the
death rate from scurvy."
<P>    "'Nother jeezly limey," croaked Cyrus, raising a shakey
glass of barley cordial as his own preventive against scurvy.
<P>    Maidstone allowed himself a brief aside in Cyrus' direction.
"Nice metaphor, really, for an illiterate alcoholic." Cyrus
missed this while staring lovingly into his glass. "The man's
actually a kind of health-and-fitness Christian. Won't let the
men forget their prayers. Sermons from the quarter-deck while
his ship sinks beneath him."
<P>    "Hell, I don't like the sound of that, Maidstone. Don't want
to have to spend all our time engaged in some kinda
hew-hew-hewmanitarian rescue effort." Enright sounded almost as
drunk as Cyrus.
<P>    A moment's quiet, then Cyrus got the point and exploded in
waves of phlegmy laughter. Even Maidstone smiled.
<P>    "The scuttlebutt has it that his last command barely made it
to Quebec. Some paper in Montreal did a cartoon of a pompous
looking sea-captain on the quarter-deck of a foundering ship.
Never mind the pumps. All hands assemble for lime-juice and
prayers."
<P>    The laughter gradually trailed off. The Colonel, massaged a
stubbly chin and looked thoughtful. "Losing his ship probably
means the man'll be extra cautious. Won't have the spirit to pay
much attention to us. Either that or he'll go for broke and try
to rebuild his reputation at our expense. We could have our
hands full just keeping an eye on him."
<P>    "You're grossly overestimating the man, Enright. Besides I'm
planning a little disruption of my own in the near future.
Should put at least one of Ames' fleet out of commission."
<P>    "Using that secret weapon of yours?" drawled Enright.
<P>    "... What the hell you two talkin' 'bout?" bawled Cyrus, now
apparently past the cheerful stage of inebriation. "You ain't
got no secret weapon, Maidstone. Lord a'mighty, I don't even
b'lieve you could tell a pistol barrel from a horse cock,
judgin' from the parson-goin'-t'meetin' way you handles that
woman a yourn. I may be kinder rough on the outside, but I kin
tell when a lady ain't gettin' what she needs ..." Here his
voice broke and he wiped an eye. "... Fuck, if I could get my
hands on a real wonnerful female crittur like that, I'd shore
pay 'ttention ..."
<P>    Maidstone exploded out of his seat like a mortar-bomb,
crashing his head against a deck beam. He rebounded back into
his seat just as quickly, doubled over and clawing at his scalp
in agonized silence.
<P>    "F'chrissakes, <I>shaddup</I>, Cyrus. Don't talk like a fuckin'
idjit." The Colonel's voice was low but commanding. "The lady's
right overhead. She might hear you."
<P>    Maidstone darted a toxic glance at Cyrus, but recoved enough
to rise up and whip an envelope out of his jacket and fling it
on the table like some winning hand at cards. He then dropped
back into his seat with gritted teeth to continue massaging his
lacerated scalp. James' fingers began to shake as Enright took
the letter and read.
<P>    "Holy ... <I>wow</I>." The Colonel sat upright, spreading out the
contents of the envelope. "You done real good this time,
Maidstone. Yeah, I was beginning to wonder. But <I>this</I> .... Say,
we're gonna have to stop and figure this out all over again."
<P>    "Yes, we owe a real debt of gratitude to Major Snell. Or at
least, we did until I paid off the man's gambling debts in
Montreal. And convinced him it might be a prudent idea to head
back to England. It was a clean departure for all of us. No
loose ends left behind."
<P>    "The British <I>secret orders</I>. Now we know which way they're
gonna jump even before <I>they</I> do. Say, according to what it says
right here on the first page, looks like they're mainly
interested in the Red River region. Gonna hang around for a
while. We'll likely pass to the south of them. That'll leave us
in the clear ... Wait a second, there's something called
supplementary orders on the next page."
<P>    Weakened by the strain of keeping balance, James' knees had
allowed the canoe to drift sideways. He now clung in desperation
to the sill of the stern window trying to haul his
transportation back underneath him. As it slid, two, then three
feet away from the hull, he ended up draped against the tarry
planking like a suspended cable, with his toes hooked
ineffectually over the escaping canoe's gunwale. Then his
fingers surrendered and he cannon-balled into the water.
<P>    "Some awful big <I>beavers</I> in these parts," remarked Cyrus.
<P>    A brisk clomping on the stairs and then a figure swayed
across the deck. Captain Loomis and Mrs. Maidstone stopped
talking.
<P>    "Whaddya see, Cyrus?" called Enright out the window.
<P>    "Waal, I swan, ... thet thar's a <I>canoe</I>. Mebbe it's that
filthy, iggerant savage I seed this afternoon. WHAR'S M'GUN?" he
bellowed.
<P>    Cyrus lurched backward across the deck, forward again, and
then -- horrors -- he was cocking and aiming a long-barrelled
rifle over the rail.
<P>    James gasped and submerged, plunging landward. The sharp
crack of the gun carried far into the depths and seemed to
hammer his skull inward from all direction. With a high,
burbling note, the ball cleaved the water just behind his back.
He clawed at the tops of deep-growing water weeds.
<P>    When he finally surfaced, all was commotion aboard the ship.
Scarecrow figures leaned over the stern waving lanterns. A
musket was fired. The canoe leapt in the water and began to sink
by the head. More shots and the frail craft was blasted into
smithereens of birchbark.
<P>    He struck out for shore. Meanwhile, a boat tethered to the
ship's far side was already receiving a crew of shouting oarsmen.
Cyrus swarmed down carrying rifle and powderhorn.
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone stood at the landward rail visible in the
lantern light. "Never you fear, ma'am," called Cyrus, all traces
of booze now evaporated from his speech. "We'll shore nuff find
the miscreant and see he don't do ya no harm. Har har."
<P>    James reached the steepest part of the rocky shoreline just
as the ship's boat pushed off. Frantic, he looked back and forth
for a way to climb out. But he could see nothing in the dark
except the lanterns of his pursuers.
<P>    "Over this way," yelled Cyrus. "Lessee if thar's anybody
still hangin' onto that canoe."
<P>    While his pursuers nosed about in the wreckage, James swam
strongly along the rock face. But each time he felt for a place
to climb, his fingers found only smooth, sharply rising
stone. He began to panic. Then after a few moments they
correctly guessed his direction. The boat began to pull closer.
Any moment they'd see him thrashing in the water.
<P>     "Hold yer oars and <I>listen</I>," shouted Cyrus. James continued
to spash along the rocky shoreline.
<P>     "I can hear him. Pull, PULL. We'll catch the murderin'
savage."
<P>     His strength was giving out. He'd have to slow down, tread
water and rest. The boat stroked nearer. He could now see the
shapes of men pulling hard, glad of a little excitement. War
whoops filled the air. "<I>Shoot</I> the bastard. <I>Shoot</I> the
bastard," someone chanted, keeping time with the sweep of the
oars.
<P>    James dived for the last time, gliding along the rock face.
He cruised in the depths until he had only a few seconds of air
left. Then his hands found a gap. Into it he darted and surfaced
in a narrow alcove screened by overhanging bushes. The boat
surged forward, close onshore. An oar grazed the rock and parted
the bushes overhead, dislodging a shower of leaves and briefly
disrupting the stroke.
<P>    "Fer gawd's sake, sheer off a bit, will ya," bellowed Cyrus
to the tillerman. "He's gotta be jist up ahaid."
<P>    Behind his screen of leaves, James gulped the night air down
to the soles of his water-filled boots. The lantern-glow
gradually disappeared down the coast. Presently the crack of a
rifle echoed from the distant rocks. Then came the sweep of the
boat's oars as his pursuers came back again, further offshore.
From the ship's side came Enright's voice:
<P>    "Catch anything, Cyrus?"
<P>    "Nuthin', dammit," came the answer. "Can't see how he coulda
gotten away. Prob'ly drowned hisself. Hell, mebbe I winged the
bastard with that first shot."
<P>    When the commotion on board ship had died down, James
crawled silently from his hiding place and clambered up the
rocks like some sodden fur-bearing animal. He stumbled inland
across ravines and up minor crags and eventually located a patch
of pine needles where he lay shivering till dawn. In retrospect,
he was glad for the sake of his feet that he'd not had time to
discard his boots in the water. But his knapsack and canoe were
gone.
<P>
<P>    First light found him peering toward the ship from a cedar
brake atop a high rock. His position was precarious, at least as
far as returning to Landry's Bay was concerned. It might take
days to get back overland, skirting every inlet and marsh along
the coast. By that time the expedition would have decamped and
written him off as dead or a deserter. And he could hardly
approach the schooner <I>Progress</I> in the broad light of day,
explain the unfortunate misunderstanding and beg for assistance.
<P>    But while he watched, a lone canoe approached from the outer
bay. He could hear someone shout a harsh greeting from the ship
or perhaps it was a warning. The canoe remained dead in the
water and there seemed to be an argument on board
the ship. A woman stood at the rail; Mrs. Maidstone, it must be,
closely involved in whatever was going on. At length the
canoe pulled in closer and she climbed down the ship's side and
stepped in. Then they headed for the same creek that James had
entered the previous day.
<P>    He abruptly abandoned his hiding place and began to scramble
over the rocks and into the trees. If he headed inland, he might
be able to cut them off at the first portage. He dashed onward,
getting deeper and deeper into the forest, leaping over
deadfalls, pausing at intervals to estimate his direction.
<P>    The terrain began to fall away in front of him as he
approached the creek valley. He burst out of the woods onto the
banks of a beaver pond. A hundred yards ahead of him a party of
three adults and a child was already disappearing into the bush.
A man was carrying the canoe on his back.
<P>    On the verge of yelling, he thought better of it owing to
the nearness of the ship. He began to force his way along the
bank of the pond toward the point where they'd vanished. Tangled
in lush vegetation and trees felled by beavers, he soon realized
he could make only slow progress. He went up the bank in hope of
finding a higher ridge where the trees were larger and the going
more open. Half-way up the flank of the hill, the opposite side
of the portage became visible. The canoe was again afloat,
heading down a small lake. Two people paddling, two passengers.
What in the name of heaven was Mrs. Maidstone thinking of,
travelling in the bush with strangers?
<P>    He'd never be able to catch them now, not on foot. Best to
follow at a more reasonable pace and hope to intercept them on
the return journey. <I>If</I> they returned this way. Or perhaps he
should turn south right away and cut back toward Landry's Bay.
There, at least, he could find food and shelter even if his
career as an army officer was finished. He began to speculate on
what he could do to exist in this wilderness. Work for Landry to
pay for the lost canoe? Hide out from his father? Even in this
obscure corner of the world, Captain Fielding of the Royal
Artillery would surely find out that his wayward son was absent
again without leave.
<P>    More unsettling thoughts: Mrs. Maidstone had been on board a
ship full of swearing, wenching riff-raff -- all last night.
While James had been lying on the pine needles shivering
uncontrollably, Mr. Maidstone had likely kept her warm by 'doing
his husbandly duty'. He wondered what, in fact, it would be like
to 'do husbandly duty' with a woman like that? He couldn't bring
himself to use the crude term, even privately. It simply didn't
fit such a splendid creature.
<P>    Trying to drive these thoughts out of his mind, he plunged
deeper inland, running along the high ridges, climbing cliffs,
overlooking the far shore of that inland lake where the distant
speck of the canoe was now pulling up to make another portage.
<P>
<P>    By mid-afternoon, after walking round the shores of several
more small lakes in succession, James wearily stumbled along a
portage that skirted a series of cascades flowing down from the
hills above. But the path seemed unused. He supposed that animal
tracks and the infrequent Indian hunter would suffice to explain
the sparse signs he was able to discover. A few saplings had
been chopped through to mark the end of the portage. From the
condition of the stumps, he guessed they'd been cut several
years back.
<P>    Coming into the open, he made his way east alongside an arm
of some larger body of water, not as yet fully visible. The sun
was behind a hill, leaving the narrow bay which he skirted in
deep obscurity. Enormous brooding pine trees lined the shores
and a thick carpet of needles capped even the shoreline rocks.
<P>    Emerging from the shadows, he gazed out onto a serene lake
dotted with tree-clad islands and surrounded by protective
hills. Their slopes were swathed in pine forest as on Landry's
Bay, except in the places where caps of white stone broke
through the green. On the north and south sides of the lake,
a few sheer cliffs vaulted out of the trees.

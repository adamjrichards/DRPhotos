<P>Vancouver for the Learned Societies Conference.
Derek and Merle to Vancouver by air.
<P>June 6, 1983
<P>
<P>Monday:
<P>
<P>I (Derek) go to Stanley Park and rent a 3-speed bicycle ($20 per
day, $3 per hour). There's a very good track along the
breakwater surrounding the park. The only problem is avoiding
pedestrians and other bicyclists; you can't invariably rely on
the convention of keeping to the right and there's always the
risk of an "after you Alphonse" misunderstanding. (This is my
first bicycle ride in decades.)
<P>
<P>Every few hundred yards, a fresh visual surprise. Going
counter-clockwise, there's first of all the Vancouver skyline on
the right, and shortly afterward, the yacht club. Swinging round
to the north, you can see all the way up the harbour to Burnaby.
Then, on the opposite side, the docks of North Vancouver come
into view with tier upon tier of suburbs sprawling up the
mountainside behind them. 
<P>
<P>Visual excitement builds to a climax as you glide under Lion's
Gate Bridge, alongside some steep cliffs on the inland side; on
the other side, you come face to face with the open harbour to
the west. Today, a line of ships are anchored far out, and in
the distance, many islands are visible on the horizon.  Passing
a succession of enticing beaches, you return to the city at
English Bay with its sunbathers and backdrop of apartment
buildings. 
<P>
<P>From English Bay I turn back to the inland paths and pump my way
up hill to have lunch at the Prospect Point Restaurant. This is
just under the Vancouver end of the Lion's Gate Bridge. A
lookout provides a good view of North Vancouver and the
structure of the bridge itself.
<P>
<P>Misfortune strikes: I wreck a 36-exposure roll of film due
to setting the film speed improperly. There's much to be said
for sticking to one type of film.  An 100 ASA film speed rating
would be best;  25 ASA Kodachrome is not fast enough for easy
woodland picture-taking, especially on cloudy days.

<P>To the Marine Museum next.  The R.C.M.P. vessel, St. Roch, is
housed within and the guided tour takes you into every nook,
cranny and footlocker of the ship. The deck is arranged to
resemble conditions in the Arctic with tents, equipment and
stuffed sled dogs, very lifelike.
<P>
<P>Among the lesser exhibits, a world map by J.W. Norie, 1829,
showing the B.N.A./U.S. border going north from 49 degrees
latitude, along the height of land in the Rockies, to the turn
of the Columbia, then down the river to Puget's Sound. Combined
with a line along the northern watershed of the Missouri, this
might have been a sensible border. We would have lost some of
Alberta and Saskatchewan and gained Washington State.  But would
Admiral Fisher have approved? It could have interfered with his
plan for a secure and direct corridor from sea to sea.
<P>
<P>Tuesday:
<P>
<P><P><B>Derek to Grouse Mountain.</B>
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0215/0215-14.jpeg">
0215-14 83-06-04 - </P>

<P>Merle is busy again with conference matters. I decide on taking
the aerial tram up Grouse Mountain, and to get there by transit,
if possible.  First, the bus from U.B.C. to the Seabus terminal
(no additional fare to go on board).  We skim across the
harbour, then another couple of buses along the back streets of
North Vancouver to the foot of Grouse Mountain.  75 cents from
U.B.C.: transit vehicle drivers issue transfers which are good
on any route, coming and going, within a generous time period. 
<P>
<P>The first driver on the north side is an Australian woman, very
friendly and talkative. She readily enters into the spirit of my
excursion and gaves me all sorts of background advice on things
like: which bus to catch next and where, the state of world
travel, the British Columbia economy, and the local real estate
market which she is heavily involved in.

<P>$6 for standing room on the aerial tramcar, a plush Euro job
with lots of windows to give you vertigo. The door shuts; the
ground falls away and we're hoisted, near vertically it seems,
into the blue sky. More and more of North Vancouver comes into
view, then the harbour, then Vancouver itself.  At intervals,
you feel a catch in the smooth upward movement as the car passes
the pylons that support the cables.  These flimsy-looking
structures of red-painted girders loom overhead, then you
swoop past with a momentary dip, briefly skimming the tree tops.

<P>The ski chalet at the top of the tramway is the normal terminus
in summer time but I decide to go one better and walk to the
very peak of the mountain.  At this height, there's still a
heavy snow pack. On reaching the top I'm able to "ski" in my
summer shoes over several hundred feet down the drifts on the
north side.  The sun is hot; the snow is melting; I find a
shady, isolated spot in the woods to sit and meditate while
overlooking the mountains to the northeast.

0215-34 83-06-04 - Summit, Grouse Mountain.</P>

<P>When the air is still, a special kind of quiet blankets mountain
tops.  Not the silence of the forest or of a suburban bedroom at
midnight.  Perhaps more like the quiet experienced by the
balloonist.  Around you is a great void and none of that
reverberation and indefinable "presence" of a narrow space. The
buzzing of a few early insects sounds faint but clear against
the distance. You can hear the small sounds of things close by
against a background that is as much felt as heard. Distant bird
calls, from way down the mountainside, seem to have a precise
location in time and space.
<P>
<P>The air is quite still today in the shadow of the spruce trees,
a river tumbles in the ravine far below, a sound I hadn't
noticed at first. Could I climb down to look at it?  Not in
these shoes. Best stay up here and watch the buds swelling.  A
spruce scent hangs in the air, opiate of the hiking class. The
lower branches of the trees are hung with pale green seaweed,
left hanging after high tide. In the distance, snow-clad peaks,
stacked in ranges, one behind the other. The nearer mountains
are probably not high enough to retain snow all summer.  A pity,
since the icing would be so much more decorative. 
<P>
<P>Something flings a handful of melting snow in my direction. I
turn round, privacy invaded, but no person, no animal is in
sight. I begin to doze, eyes are closing, then it happens again
-- another handful of snow spontaneously flicks into the air.
But this time I see the cause. Every few minutes, as the snow
melts, a sapling snaps up and out of the drifts, finally
released from its winter-long sleep by the sun, to kick aside
the blanket of ice crystals. 
<P>
<P>How to convey this moment before the ardour for scenery cools? 
How to make verbal landscapes interesting to the reader who has
learned to crave fast-breaking action or dote on the endless
soap-opera episodes of human conflict.  Put in avalanches?
Thunderstorms?  Mountain climbers dangling above the abyss,
shrieking imprecations while they saw feverishly at each other's
ropes with oversize bowie knives?
<P>
<P>What if I should sicken at the sight of too many pine trees,
surfeits of jagged rocks, excess fluffy clouds? And begin to
ask: why am I here?  To do what? ... To gaze at those distant
peaks, misty valleys over and over again, to spy out yet another
route to the horizon, and to keep moving on. Perhaps there'll be
another prospect, as good, even more magnificent than this. 
<P>

0215-36 83-06-04 - Visitors from Germany.</P>

<P>On the way back down to the cable car station, I meet two German women and
their children. They're enjoying lunch at the top of the hill while
overlooking the ski chalet and a background view that extends all the way to
the Olympic Mountains in Washinton State.  These are the only other hikers
who have ventured this far from the top of the tramway.  While
lederhosen-clad youngsters clamber over the rocks, their mothers share a part
of their lunch with me.  The children have obviously not been warned
beforehand that it's a difficult thing to clamber up steep rocks and melting
snowbanks and they bound over the slopes with ease.

<P>
<P>I remember a certain morning, at this same season, in the 1950s,
at the very top of the Zugspitze, in Germany, also reached by an aerial
tramway. On that day, I also took pictures of a pair of German
girls on holiday; we exchanged smiles, addresses and the promise
to write and send pictures.  A certain rapture of the heights, a
curious bonnehommie, afflicts even those cautious climbers who
make their ascents by cablecar. But people hardly ever get round
to writing or sending the promised pictures.

<P>Something is wrong with the cable car machinery and
the operator sends us down by means of a technique described on
the cable car's control panel as "autodescent". Hope this is not
a euphemism for free-fall.

<P>Safely at the bottom again, I stroll down into Capilano Canyon, starting
at the Cleveland Dam. This is a paradise of rocky gorges, huge trees, mossy
rocks and winding paths.  But it's the sort of beauty that has to be taken in
small doses since I've already done enough Zen meditation up top. Don't want
to OD on scenery. You have to sit on a bench and pretend to read the Globe
and Mail financial page, only looking up now and then to let a little
gorgeousness creep in around the edges. 
<P>
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0216/0216-14.jpeg">
0216-14 83-06-04 - </P>

<P>Consulting the map, I decide to go for a refreshing swim.  A
beach is marked in at the bottom of the canyon.  The pathway
down leaps from one fern-brake to the next, dodging between the
trunks of enormous cedars.  I bound out of the bushes onto the
beach and suprise a couple of skinny dippers down at the other
end enjoying their solitude.
<P>
<P>At the far end of the sandbar that forms the beach, a miniature
waterfall drops directly over the cliff and into the river. The
girl floats on her back, supported on an innertube with the
water splashing down on her ... belly. Emerging from the water,
she stretchs out on the sand pretending to ignore me.  Her
boyfriend turns discreetly over on his stomach.  But while I
prepare for swimming, the two of them are surrepticiously
pulling up their modesty and contriving to remain lying down at
the same time. 
<P>
<P>This puts me in somewhat of a quandry, being by this time nearly
ready for a cooling dip myself.  I'm on the point of waving
cheerily and urging them to get naked again as a gesture of
re-affirmation toward Mother Nature, but think better of it and
temporarily re-establish my own modesty, all the while
pretending to inspect the bushes in the opposite direction for
interesting bird life.
<P>
<P>The water is very refreshing even without members of the cast of
The Age of Aquarius as companions.  And then back on the road again,
via a bus downtown over the Lion's Gate Bridge. In Vancouver for
dinner, I meet Merle and we go to a Mexican restaurant for red
snapper and guacamole. How was the conference today, dear?
<P>
<P>Oh, boring as usual. How was YOUR day?

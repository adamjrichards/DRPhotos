<P>    "I tell you," said Harris, "I distinctly saw a gold coin
change hands."
<P>    James squinted in disbelief. At that very moment, Mr.
Maidstone was sitting bored and prim looking with his wife in a
distant canoe while all of them were being paddled westward by
the indefatiguable canoe men. Maidstone had begun to seem more
like an inconvenient rival than a real threat to the expedition.
It was hard to maintain a sense of moral superiority when
Fielding and not Maidstone could be construed as the real
interloper.
<P>    "Well, surely he wouldn't just part with his money to make
friends. Something underhanded must be going on. And <I>we're</I> not
in on it. I mean ..."
<P>    "Excellent! Professional jealousy. Didn't I say in Lachine
you'd make a promising young cad?"
<P>    "Harris, you <I>know</I> what I mean."
<P>    Emerging from a dreamy awareness of towering cloud
formations, James abruptly switched over to a watchful
surveillance of every detail around him. The brigade was now
pressing on toward the entrance of the North Channel where an
east-west range of mountains was visible some miles inland.
Turning north, they paddled up a narrow strait between a sizable
island and the mainland. At the end, lay a wide bay with
white-crowned hills rising on the far side.
<P>    "We stop here, couple days," announced the steersman.
"Unload two-t'ree piece cargo, fix bad canoe. We go ashore, see
Mr. Landry. He live inside bay." 
<P>    "Just as I suspected," whispered Harris. "The brigade
leader's got a woman up here. So while he dallies, the rest of
us will have an unequalled opportunity to study the natural
history of the region." This latter prospect, in James' mind at
least, helped to compensate for any delay in reaching the
promised land.
<P>    Captain Ames displayed an irritation quite out of his normal
character. "Look here, my good man, is this absolutely
necessary? We are already three days behind the vanguard of the
brigade as it is."
<P>    "Sure, is necessary, Capitaine. Don' worry, we make good
time anyhow." 
<P>    "But surely you and your men are capable of discharging a
bale or two of cargo in a few minutes. And even the most
cretinous canoe man could certainly boil up a kettle of pitch in
a couple of hours, more or less."
<P>    "I make you deal, Capitaine. You pay me couple hundred pound
and you take canoe and cargo youself. I hope you boys here don'
mind to bail water all way to Fort William." 
<P>    "I think he has us," said Harris to James. "Out with your
paintbox. We are about to stretch our legs on the Georgian
strand. Dear me, Friday already; looks like we should have a
restful weekend."
<P>    "This is sheer, willful obstruction," muttered the Captain.
"I shall remark on it in my report."
<P>    No offer of purchase being forthcoming, the steersman
pointed out the new course.  "We go in there. You see behin'
reeds, some big rocks on beach?"  They turned landward and drew
up on a gradually shelving shore.
<P>    "Well, it does seem an ideal spot for fishing." The Captain
huffed for a while but was already beginning to show signs of
reconciliation to the inevitable.
<P>    Their leader, James noted, in no way resembled Admiral
Fisher. Like any other practical mariner, the Admiral, it could
be assumed, was frequently compelled to change tack. But despite
each alteration in course, Fisher was the sort of man who would
continue to steer toward that special island marked with an "X".
James wasn't quite so sure if there was any "X" in Captain Ames'
long-term strategy.
<P>    And yet he could also see the unfairness of carping
criticism. On the one hand, he and Harris were regularly
irritated by the Captain's steadfast attention to the logistics 
of travel. On the other hand, a leader who apparently lacked the
resolution -- or perhaps even the imagination -- to draw his
officers into a coherent strategy for an entire voyage made them
both nervous. Was it too much or too little determination? Or
both?
<P>    A series of huge, reddish-coloured outcrops marked the spot
where they'd put in to shore. Polished surfaces reared up among
the trees, immune to the forces that had shattered other parts
of the coastline. The steersman had more irrelevancies for the
Captain to digest.
<P>    "Take care you boys don' camp too close by these rocks. Some
say there may be old-time Indian med'cine in this place." 
<P>    "That settles it, we shall camp precisely here." Captain
Ames seemed relieved to have his opinion finally prevail. The
steersman shrugged his shoulders and set off through the trees
to locate Mr. Landry. Apparently, this prestigious individual
represented one of the few shreds of settlement holding its own
on the far shore of Lake Huron. 
<P>    Whatever it was that was "up" showed no sign of making an
appearance. The under-exercised troopers cheerfully made camp.
James opened his notebook, eager to record observations.
<P>    "Harris, look how polished that rock is. In some places you
can see distinct grooves. And they all seem to go in the same
direction. Take a compass bearing, like a good chap, and tell me
what direction those grooves lie."
<P>    Harris looked obstinately inland at the rest of the party
going about their tasks. James scratched busily in his notebook
as he talked, looking up now and then at the rocks, then out
across the bay to the background hills.
<P>    "Not hard to understand why the Indians might have singled
out this place. Good fishing, memorable landmarks, shelter from
the full sweep of Georgian Bay. What do you say we try to
calculate the height of those mountains over there?"
<P>    James indicated a hill swathed in a thick cover of pine
trees. A crown of pristine white stone protruded at the top.  A
few other summits showed similar flashes of underlying white.
The backbone of one bare ridge was spiked with the criss-crossed
trunks of burnt trees. 
<P>    Harris was now staring at the hill in question as if it had
no right to be there. "About two or three miles off, I'd guess.
You're the astronomer, train your own sextant on the mountain
peaks. I'm going to focus my spyglass on Mr. Maidstone. Where's
he run off to anyway?" 
<P>    "Must be eight or nine hundred feet above water level, at
least. Wonder how long it'd take us to get over there and climb
up?" James squinted across the bay.  "I'm sorry, what were you
saying?" 
<P>
<P>    Preparations for the evening meal were soon in hand. As the
cooks stoked the fire and prepared the usual stewy concoction,
two men approached down a narrow trail through the trees. The
steersman introduced his friend Mr. Landry, who immediately
pressed on Captain Ames a large and still dripping mess of fish.
<P>    "Bless my soul, what a splendid catch of pickerel. To what
do we owe this surprise?"
<P>    "I tell Landry here we have to give small bribe. Keep
Capitaine Ames from take my canoe an' paddle away by himself. So
Landry say we feed him up good so he sleep tight for two-t'ree
days. Then we ready to push off again."
<P>    Landry nodded sagely and selected a felled tree that had
been stripped of bark. He flopped the fish down on this
improvised cutting block. One or two finny tails still gave
convulsive twitches. Extracting a long-bladed knife from the
bosom of his disreputable buckskin shirt, he proceeded to gut
the afternoon's catch.  The rough exterior of this backwoods
settler concealed the skill of a Michaelangelo with the fish
knife. On the inside, each fish was really a fillet. One had
only to remove the extraneous matter, head, entrails, fins, to
reveal the creature's true essence. 
<P>    The cleaning done, Landry collected the remains on a few
large leaves. Despite the radical dismemberment, the scraps were
still alive. A toothy mouth gaped, attached to a distant tail by
a long section of backbone and ribs. A heart pulsated in a mass
of guts. Landry carried the entrails away from the campsite and
left them on a large rock in the woods.
<P>    "They be gone by morning," he assured them. The two French
Canadians returned down the path they had come, issuing
invitations to visit the "village" soon.
<P>    Captain Ames and his group supplemented their stew with
fried fish. No one could praise it enough. The Maidstones shared
the meal and the combined group sat round the campfire in the
stillness of dusk. 
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone chatted freely while her husband remained his
usual taciturn self. "Is it not extremely odd, Captain Ames, to
feast on filet of pickerel while the entrails sit on that rock
glaring at us for what we have done?" 
<P>    "Quite the contrary, Madam. The fish of the sea and the
animals of the forest were put there expressly for our benefit
by a beneficent creator. You need have no qualms about the
workings of Providence." The Captain had no qualms about
polishing off the last morsels of his own portion. 
<P>    "Indeed, sir," offered Harris in an unusually earnest tone,
"in a wealthy house in France, they might use tureens and
serving dishes made to resemble fish and fowl. I myself have
seen chinaware creatures, with the most beatific expressions,
looking positively joyful to serve up their own kind for the
delectation of elegant company."
<P>    "Were you in France?" James forever felt awestruck at
Harris' cosmopolitanism.
<P>    "Er, ... the chinaware I saw was spirited out of the country
some time ago, before the troubles began. ... Family heirlooms,
you might say."
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone would not be taken in. "You are teasing us,
surely, Mr. Harris.  Nothing  is 'joyful' at being eaten. The
Hindoos eat no meat at all and avoid the smallest blot on their
conscience. And the Jews, at least, avoid the reproaches of
swine." 
<P>    Harris stared abstractedly into the fire. "Not entirely so,
I fear." 
<P>    A shriek from the bushes galvanized them all. The sun's last
rays revealed a frenzy of pouncing fur where the fish entrails
had been set out. Low against the rock, two shadowy forms
scuttled to and fro, eyes and teeth flashing, then scampered
into the shadows. Another shriek, more distant, and again the
quiet lapping of water on the beach.
<P>    James broke the silence. "Some of the Indian tribes have an
even stranger idea. Instead of assuming their food longs to be
eaten, like the French, or avoiding the slaughter altogether,
like the Hindoos, they kill it anyway, but apologize to the
animal's spirit." 
<P>    Captain Ames belched politely and rose to his feet,
massaging his paunch. The party broke up soon after, each
heading for his own patch of shelter. A few huddled beneath
overturned canoes, or took refuge under improvised lean-to's of
canvas. One or two hardy souls simply lay down on the sand and
stared upward at the emerging stars.
<P>    Long after Harris was asleep, James was still wondering
about the creatures that had cleaned up the fish offal. Were
they coons or wildcats, wolverines or foxes? Perhaps they'd been
two different and hostile species, competing for the same scrap
of food.  In any case, Mrs. Maidstone was right. It <I>was</I> odd to
devour the fish and politely discuss the matter while the guts
were still squirming. It was even odder if you were the one
watching your own dismemberment and subsequent digestion. But
no matter, whoever had gulped down those remains would likely
have his own pelt nailed to the barn door to make a warm fur
cap for Mr. Landry this coming winter.
<P>    And the <I>Jews</I>, at least, avoid the reproaches of swine ...
family heirlooms smuggled out of France ... James began to
wonder about his enigmatic midshipman friend. And about Harris'
relationship to Admiral Fisher ... and about his own
relationship to Mrs. Maidstone, his muse of the paintbrush.
<P>
<P>    The sunset had been a promising red and now the moon stood
high in the heavens. A few wavelets still lapped the beach, the
last energy remaining of the previous day's blustery winds.
James got up from his bed on the sand. The far surface of the
bay was mirror calm, and across it, the ghostly tops of bald
mountains shone dimly. He made his way into the woods toward
those protruding rocks the steersman had cautioned them to
avoid. As he slipped through the trees, he felt a bond of
kinship with the prowling animals who'd cleaned up the remains
of the fish.
<P>    The nearest of the medicine rocks shimmered silver in the
moonlight, the only clear shape visible among the trees. The
smooth, seamless surface was still warm when he reached out to
steady himself. He ran his hand over a round, polished flank.
His fingers found a crevice and he pulled himself part way up
and sat to consider. In the grass at the foot of the mound, a
cricket broke into song, startling in its loudness. Lying back
to contemplate the skies, he tried to remember his astronomy
teacher's instructions for determining longitude from the
eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter. 
<P>    A bat flitted overhead in erratic swoops. James raised his
head to follow its movement. As it dived for the woods, his
thoughts gravitated back to earth and the rock on which he lay.
Running his hands over its smooth textures, he had the uneasy
feeling it resembled human flesh. His cheeks flushed as he lay
down to face the moon and contemplate the images that offered
themselves to his imagination. With his other hand he tried to
press himself back into quiescence, only succeeding in heating
his imagination still more.
<P>    A tiny pebble rolled and bounced down the side of the rock
and came to a halt against his shoulder. He flung aside his
reverie to roll over on his belly and squint up the incline.
Squatting atop the rock was a motionless shape -- he'd once seen
a fearsome Indian shaman wearing a cloak of bark. His heart
pounded as he remembered the steersman's advice not to camp too
close to this place.
<P>    A liquid voice floated down. "James, do come up and sit by
me."
<P>    The squat shape resolved itself into the sitting figure of
Mrs. Maidstone with her skirts gathered round her like a tent.
Her head had been pillowed on her knees as she watched him. She
raised it and the white face now became visible in the
moonlight. Clambering on all fours, he made his way up the
incline to her side, supremely glad that his erotic imagination
had not got the better of him, with her watching.
<P>    "I knew it was you, even in the dark -- from the way you ran
your fingers over the stone. I suppose you and I must be the
only true sensualists in this company." There was something in
the sibilants of her speech that sent a tremor through his body.
"Tell me, what were you thinking of?"
<P>    He decided that a partial explanation was safer than the
whole truth. "I was trying to remember how to use the satellites
of Jupiter to determine longitude."
<P>    "And I've been up here an hour entreating the Spirits to
forgive us for our fish dinner." She put her head down on her
knees again and looked at him with a moon-flecked eye.  Her own
sensual fingers, tracing a circle on the rock close to his hand,
brushed his. "And what else were you thinking of?" she wheedled
after a significant pause. 
<P>    He forced himself to look away from those huntress' orbs. In
the darkness, he tried without success to divine some pattern in
the confused wilderness of pleated stuff that made up her
skirts.  His gaze fled down to the hem of her garment where the
tip of a naked foot protruded. She shifted position slightly and
the foot emerged. Sufficient to reveal a bare ankle and the
beginnings of a calf. He groaned and seized the foot, planting a
kiss on the instep.
<P>    "I was thinking of you," he whispered, eyes averted from
hers.
<P>    She rumpled his hair as he timidly explored the fullness of
her calf. When he dared at last to look up into her face, she
was adoring the moon. Her countenance had the radiance of a
thankful worshipper ... of the goddess Diana.
<P>
<P>    They exchanged caresses and conversed in murmurs for the
rest of the night. Before dawn, he helped her down from the rock
and led her back through the trees, clasping her hand till they
reached the edge of the sleeping campsite. With a parting flash
of bright eyes, she vanished into the shadows.
<P>    He could hear Sergeant Crocker snoring guard duty over near
the pile of stores. A single coal of the campfire winked and
emitted a fragile thread of sweet-smelling smoke. Across the bay
and to the east, the sky had begun to lighten.
<P>
<P>    The next morning they learned that their journey could not
be resumed for even better reasons than previous: the
unexplained absence of unspecified members of the canoe brigade on
"urgent business." With nothing to do, James made his way toward
the cabin of the man who had provided them with the previous
evening's fish dinner. After his nocturnal adventure, he needed
a stroll to collect his thoughts.
<P>    The tiny log house possessed a sprawling accumulation of
sheds, woodpiles and gardens, even a cow-byre, all linked by
well-beaten paths radiating in every direction. There was no
doubt Landry was determined to make a permanent home here.
James was invited inside the cabin to meet the <I>bonne femme</I>
who shared the life of a settler. The variety of paraphernalia
the man had gotten together in this out-of-the-way spot was
amazing. On the crowded mantle, a Yankee clock from New Haven
shared space with most of the gadgets and bric-a-brac found in
any country home of the more settled regions. Landry explained
how he obtained the things he needed by placing requests with
his friends in the canoe brigades that regularly passed within
hail.
<P>    As a former employee of the fur trade, Landry had taken a
liking to this strategic point on the approach to the North
Channel, passing it many times in his journeyings between
Montreal and the Northwest.  In five years he'd carved out a
clearing, built himself a cabin and taken an Indian wife. Now he
eked out a living by fishing, gardening and cattle raising, with
a bit of trapping and local trading on the side. Several of his
cronies from the passing brigades had followed his example. A
hamlet had sprung up. He boasted to James that ships regularly
put into this cove from the more populated shores to the South
of Georgian Bay. And only the other day he'd sold fish to a
schooner hailing all the way from Buffalo on Lake Erie. 
<P>    "Do you ever go inland?" James had in mind exploring the
hills he could see from the shore of the bay. 
<P>    "Not much. We 'ave some good lakes, rivers, back there. Nice
fishing, some places. But too many portages for me. Mountains
too big, lakes too deep. Most of the time, I'm sticking to this
bay, me. Plenty of big fish, easy to bring back to my cabin."
<P>    "You say, big mountains, deep lakes?"
<P>    "Eh bien, bigger mountains than you see over there. Lakes so
deep, you let out fifty fathom line, still no bottom. That
country, too much up, too much down, you <I>comprend</I>?  I like to
see a few sail on the water, canoe from Montreal, Fort
William. Not so lonely. Hey, you want to go up there? I rent
you small canoe, easy to portage.  She goes well in very small
river. You need guide? Sometimes my Indian friend next door,
he go up there to make med'cine, catch fish. Maybe he go
today. Or maybe, you like to go alone?"
<P>    James snatched at the chance to make a quick foray into the
back country. If he climbed up one of the higher hills, he'd be
able to get a better look at the surrounding terrain. His spirit
had soared on previous jaunts up the few mountains near
Montreal. But in addition, he also suspected he'd best abscond a
while from the scene of last night's foray into the wilds of
love. He wasn't at all sure he could face the clear-eyed Mrs.
Maidstone in the full light of day. And then there was her nasty
husband. A man whose gaze was not at all clear-eyed.
<P>    The bargain concluded, Landry gave him general instructions
to cross the bay and enter a certain inlet. From there he'd have
a long reach inland to a point where he could meander upstream
to the interior.
<P>    Returning to the campsite, James secured permission for his
project. "To do some useful reconnaissance. Not to break your
neck," the Captain warned. Inwardly, James shrugged off the
overfamiliar note of fatherly concern.
<P>    Harris was engrossed in an antique, leather-bound volume
decorated with odd, foreign lettering on the cover. He closed it
with a snap when James approached, politely declining the
invitation to participate in a scouting expedition to the
interior. 
<P>    "I shall use the day for sorting my kit and other
meditations of an improving nature, thank you very much. Now run
along and play at exploring. I shall cultivate the civilized
arts of watching and overhearing." He winked at James and nodded
his head in the direction of Maidstone, lately emerged from
overnight shelter and now glumly poking the fire with a stick.
"Oh, before I forget, Mrs. Maidstone asked if you could supply
her with a few sheets of drawing paper, some charcoal and
paints."
<P>    He left the drawing and painting things for Mrs. Maidstone
and put his own supplies, including a small bag of bread and
pemmican, into a knapsack slung over his shoulder. Then he set
off to get his canoe from Landry.
<P>
<P>    It was already late afternoon. At the head of the inlet that
Landry had described, James entered a narrow channel whose
entrance was almost hidden from the open water of the bay.
According to his instructions, this would broaden into the shape
of a key at its extreme end. He was wearing his roughest
clothing in anticipation of having to push through the thorns
and briers of the back country. His sweat-stained buckskin shirt
was unbuttoned to the navel. Wisps of hair hung over his face.
Paddling close to the southern shore, he reached the end of the
inlet and swung to the right, steering into the tip of the key.
<P>    A schooner was anchored near the rocks ahead of him. Lines
ran fore and aft to tall pine trees on shore. Sudden confusion
struck him and the canoe drifted while he took stock. He'd been
paddling for most of the day, his only companions a few
inquisitive loons. Coming to terms with solitude was easy -- new
vistas unfolded at every mile -- but his mind had slumbered with
the steady rhythm of the paddle. He'd given himself over to his
senses, abandoning all thoughts of motive, cause and effect.
<P>    He drifted under the stern of the moored vessel. A faded
name plate proclaimed her to be the <I>Progress</I> out of Buffalo.
Paddling cautiously along the vessel's side, he had the uneasy
feeling of looking "a proper ruffian". That was how Harris would
have put it. A man was sitting on a cask next to the mainmast
cleaning a rifle. He stood up, sauntered over to the rail and
ejected a neat stream of tobacco juice into the water near the
canoe.
<P>    "HEY! You from these parts? You speak English?"
<P>    It seems he did indeed look a proper ruffian. Rumpled
buckskins open to the waist. The disreputable, hairy aspect that
comes of weeks of travel in the remoter Canadas. On an impulse,
he scratched himself under the arm and regarded the stranger
with an insolent, open-mouthed stare. The man on deck resembled
someone he'd seen before.
<P>    "I'm talkin' to ya, sonny. Maybe ya don't hear too good."
<P>    "What you come here for?" was James' surly answer. "You want
buy fish?"
<P>    The other looked disgusted. "Takin' on some wood, if it's
any a yer damn business. Away with ya. We don't want no more a
yer wormy fish." A few more rough-looking characters began to
emerge from a hatchway. These now lined the rail eyeing him
suspiciously.
<P>    James resumed paddling, prudence telling him to feign an
unhurried departure. He headed for the creek leading to the
interior, still puzzled as to why a ship gathering wood should
demonstrate precious little evidence of any foraging activity on
shore. 
<P>    "Whozat?" came a voice from the ship's cabin where the stern
lights were propped open. "Any sign of him yet?"
<P>    "Naw, jist some filthy, iggerant half-breed goin' fishin'."
The man on watch resumed his seat by the mainmast. "Say, how
long we gonna hafta sit here an' wait? I'm gettin' pow'ful
thirsty."
<P>    "He should be coming by any day now, Cyrus. And I told you
already, no whiskey till sundown. Why don't you just fetch out
your Kentucky rifle. Pass the time with a little target
practice. Should be enough squirrels, pole-cats and two-legged
varmints around to keep you happy."
<P>    Cyrus! Hearing that name, James almost lost his paddle
overboard. So this was Colonel Enright and his party, heading
west toward Lake Superior via the falls of St. Mary. Their last
meeting had been at Sackets Harbor. On that occasion, he'd
fallen into the Colonel's clutches like some foolish mouse in
the claws of a hootowl. James dug his paddle into the water and
sped round a turn in the shoreline.
<P>    For months he'd pictured Enright and his schemes as
impossibly remote, vanishing in the emptiness of the prairies,
heading unstoppably towards those longed-for snowy mountains in
the far west. He'd been quietly infuriated by the man's Yankee
self-assurance. At the same time, half-envious of the mysterious
survey assignment the Colonel had landed beyond the Missouri
territory.
<P>    Their own mission to survey the western boundary regions had
apparently been curtailed in favour of some useless camping-out
party on the Red River. James had never really believed he'd
see Enright again. Now it all came back: incarceration in that
narrow dungeon in Sackets Harbor, being caged in the ship's
cable locker on Lake Ontario. Even out here in the open air, the
mildew odours of confinement seemed to overpower the fresh pine
scent of the forested shore. He fled the vicinity of the
schooner <I>Progress</I> without another glance backward.

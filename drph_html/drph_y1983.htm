 1983 year Vancouver, In search of JF *

</B><BR><A href="y1983-all.htm?zoom_highlight=" target="_parent">all pics</A>


<BR>This version of the 1983 year portfolio began simply as a picture
collection. Diary segments were added later. Since then I've been trying to
decide which is best: a photo diary with limited textual commentary or a full
diary with inserted pctures. Or perhaps they both converge toward to the same
thing.

<BR clear='all'><P> The Learned Societies diary segments result from a trip with
Merle to a conference in Vancouver. The connection with James
Fielding in my novel, The Scarlet Thread, is indirect. and
based on a second novel, Premonitions of the Past, about the
adventures of my alter ego, Richard Peters, who is supposed to
be the writer of The Scarlet Thread.

<BR clear='all'><P> The motor trip segment is an  account of an actual research
trip by car, west and along the 49th parallel, to gather
impressions for The Scarlet Thread. This had already been
through several drafts and was still in the process of revision.

<BR clear='all'><P> The main character of the novel is young James Fielding
(referred to as JF) who is a member of a British expedition in
1816 gathering intelligence on the vaguely defined frontier area
between British and US territory. Part of their mission is to
shadow the route of a similar American expedition whose real
purpose is to provide support for Jeffersonian expansionism in
the Northwest.

<BR clear='all'><P> 
I rent a 3-speed bike ($3 per hour).
Good track along the breakwater round
the park. One minor problem: avoiding
walkers and other cyclists.
You can't rely on keeping to the
right. You risk an "after-you-Alphonse"
incident. (First bike ride in decades.)
<BR clear='all'><P> Every few hundred yards, a fresh visual surprise. Going
counter-clockwise, the Vancouver skyline on
the right, and shortly after, the yacht club. Swinging round
to the north, you can see all the way up the harbour to Burnaby.
Then, on the far side, the docks of North Vancouver come
into view, with tier upon tier of suburbs sprawling up the
mountainside beyond. 

<BR clear='all'><P> Visual excitement builds to a climax gliding under Lion's Gate
Bridge, alongside some steep cliffs on the inland side. West of
the bridge, the open harbour. Today, a line of ships is
anchored far out, and in the distance, islands are visible on
the horizon.  Passing a succession of enticing beaches, a
return to the city at English Bay with its sunbathers and
backdrop of apartment buildings. 

<BR clear='all'><P> From English Bay I turn back to the inland paths and, in Stanley
Park again, pump the bike up hill to have lunch at the Prospect
Point Restaurant. This is just under the Vancouver end of the
Lion's Gate Bridge. A lookout provides a good view of North
Vancouver and the structure of the bridge itself.

<BR clear='all'><P> Misfortune strikes: I wreck a 36-exposure roll of film due
to setting the film speed improperly. There's much to be said
for sticking to one type of film.  An 100 ASA film speed rating
would be best;  25 ASA Kodachrome is not fast enough for easy
woodland picture-taking, especially on cloudy days.

<BR clear='all'><P> The R.C.M.P. vessel, St. Roch, is
housed within and the guided tour
takes you into every nook, cranny
and footlocker of the ship.
The deck is arranged to resemble
conditions in the Arctic with
tents, equipment and stuffed sled
dogs, very lifelike.

<BR clear='all'><P> Among the lesser exhibits, a world map by J.W. Norie, 1829,
showing the B.N.A./U.S. border going north from 49 degrees
latitude, along the height of land in the Rockies, to the turn
of the Columbia, then down the river to Puget's Sound. Combined
with a line along the northern watershed of the Missouri, this
might have been a sensible border. We would have lost some of
Alberta and Saskatchewan and gained Washington State.  But would
Admiral Fisher have approved? It could have interfered with his
plan for a secure and direct corridor from sea to sea.

<BR clear='all'><P> 15-11-05: I hadn't recorded the name or purpose of this building
in 1983. But remembered that it was within walking distance from
the Vancouver Art Gallery (0215-09 below). Consulted Google satellite
maps showing the gallery location, but was only able to identify a
very large rectangular structure that looked more like a railway
station from the air.

<BR clear='all'><P> Finally solved the problem with Google
Street View. A tour at Ground level round the above structure,
dodging virtual traffic, finally showed a flying buttress as in
the pic below. Digitally zooming-in on a pedestrian entrance to
this building actually revealed a readable name plaque.

<BR clear='all'><P> Merle is busy again with conference matters, so I decide to check out
the aerial tram up Grouse Mountain, and to get there by transit,
if possible.  First, the bus from U.B.C. to the Seabus terminal
(no additional fare to go on board).  We skim across the
harbour, then another couple of buses along the back streets of
North Vancouver to the foot of Grouse Mountain.  75 cents from
U.B.C.: transit drivers issue transfers that are good
on any route, coming and going, within a generous time period. 

<BR clear='all'><P> The first driver on the north side is an Australian woman, very
friendly and talkative. She readily enters into the spirit of my
excursion and provides all sorts of free advice on things
like: which bus to catch next and where, the state of world
travel, the British Columbia economy, and the local real estate
market which she is heavily involved in.

 $6 for standing room on the aerial tramcar.

<BR clear='all'><P> This is a plush Euro job with lots of windows to give you
vertigo. The door shuts; the ground falls away and we're
hoisted, near vertically it seems, into the blue sky. More and
more of North Vancouver comes into view, then the harbour, then
Vancouver itself across the water.  At intervals, you feel a
catch in the smooth upward movement as the car passes the pylons
that support the cables.  These flimsy-looking structures loom
overhead, then you swoop past with a momentary dip, briefly
skimming the tree tops.

The ski chalet at the top of the tramway is the normal terminus
in summer.

<BR clear='all'><P> Let's go one better and walk to the very peak of the mountain. 
At this height, there's still a heavy snow pack. I reach the top
and "ski" in summer shoes several hundred feet down the drifts
on the north side.  The sun is hot; the snow is melting; there's
a shady, isolated spot in the woods to sit and meditate while
overlooking the mountains to the northeast.

 In still air, a special kind of quiet blankets mountain tops.

<BR clear='all'><P> Not the silence of the forest or of a suburban bedroom at
midnight. More like the quiet experienced by a balloonist.  All
around, a great void and none of that reverberation and
indefinable "presence" of a narrow space. The buzzing of a few
early insects sounds faint but clear against the distance. The
small sounds of things close by stand out against a background
that is felt as much as heard. Distant bird calls, way down the
mountainside, have a precise location in time and space.

<BR clear='all'><P> A river tumbles in the ravine far below, a sound not noticeable
at first. Climb down for a look?  Not in these shoes. Best stay
up here and watch the buds swelling.  A spruce scent hangs in
the air, opiate of the hiking class. The lower branches of the
trees are hung with pale green seaweed-moss, left hanging after
winter's high tide. In the distance, snow-clad peaks, stack up
in ranges, one behind the other. The nearer mountains are
probably not high enough to retain snow all summer.  A pity,
since the icing would be so much more decorative.

<I>83-06-04</I> - <B>Summit, Grouse Mountain.</B>

 Something flings a handful of melting snow at me.

<BR clear='all'><P> I twist round, privacy invaded, but no person, no animal is in
sight. Back into a doze, eyes closing, then it happens again.
Another handful of snow flicks spontaneously into the air.
But this time the cause is clear. Every few minutes, as the snow
melts, a sapling snaps up and out of the drifts, finally
released from a winter-long sleep by the sun, to kick aside
the blanket of ice crystals. 
<BR clear='all'><P> Writer's crisis: How to convey this moment before the ardour for scenery
cools?  How to make verbal landscapes interesting to the reader who has
learned to crave fast-breaking action, or who dotes on the endless soap-opera
episodes of human conflict.  Put in avalanches? Thunderstorms?  Mountain
climbers dangling above the abyss, shrieking imprecations while they saw
feverishly at each other's ropes with oversize bowie knives? I actually
remember a Canlit story that went much like that.

<BR clear='all'><P> And what if boredom should set in at the sight of too many pine trees,
surfeits of jagged rocks, excess fluffy clouds? You might begin
to ask: what's the point of coming here? To do what? ... To gaze
at distant peaks, misty valleys, over and over again, to spy out
yet another route to a horizon that you'll never reach, to keep
moving restlessly on. After all, there could be another
prospect, even more magnificent than this, tomorrow. So why hang
around?

 .The view extends all the way to the Olympic Mountains
in Washinton State.  These are the only other hikers who have
ventured this far from the top of the tramway.  While cheerful
youngsters clamber over the rocks, their mothers share a part of
their lunch with me.  The children have obviously not been warned
beforehand that it's dangerous to clamber up steep rocks and
melting snowbanks and they bound over the slopes with ease.

small doses, since I've already done too much Zen meditation up top. Don't want
to OD on scenery. You have to sit on a bench and pretend to read the Globe

<BR clear='all'><P> Consulting the map, I decide to go for a refreshing swim.  On
the map, a small beach is shown at the bottom of the canyon. 
The pathway down leaps from one fern-brake to the next, dodging
between the trunks of enormous cedars.  I bound out of the
bushes onto the beach and suprise a couple of skinny dippers
down at the other end enjoying their solitude.

<BR clear='all'><P> At the far end of the sandbar that forms the beach, a miniature
waterfall drops directly over the cliff and into the river. The
girl floats on her back, supported on an innertube with the
water splashing down on her ... belly. Emerging from the water,
she stretchs out on the sand pretending to ignore me.  Her
boyfriend turns discreetly over on his stomach.  But while I
prepare for swimming, the two of them are surrepticiously
pulling up their modesty and contriving to remain lying down at
the same time. 

<BR clear='all'><P> This puts me in somewhat of a quandry, being by this time nearly
ready for a cooling dip myself.  I'm on the point of waving
cheerily and urging them to get naked again, as a gesture of
re-affirmation toward Mother Nature, but think better of it and
temporarily re-establish my own modesty, all the while
pretending to inspect the bushes in the opposite direction for
interesting bird life.

<BR clear='all'><P> The above excerpt is from my second novel: Premonitions of the
Past. This chapter is an impressionistic adaptation of an
actual nude swim on Wreck Beach. The novel is an (almost
fictional) account of the peregrinations, marital and
geographical, of the writer of The Scarlet Thread.
<B><P>Motor trip to BC, Aug. 1983.</B>
 _ In search of James Fielding, hero
of Derek's novel: The Scarlet
Thread. 
 _ Following Fielding's
route: Ft. William, Red River, Ft.
Mandan on the Missouri, Alberta
Foothills, and finally, the Rockies
 _ This is a second westward trip this
year, not to be confused with our
earlier trip to Vancouver by air.
<BR clear='all'><P> In 1816, an unlikely expedition led by Captain Jonah Ames, R.N.,
explored the future boundary area of British North America,
moving west from the Red River along the 49th parallel to the
Rockies and beyond. This is the record of a 1983 motor trip
which followed the track of that expedition. 

<BR clear='all'><P> Note: Diary dates should be prefered over picture dates. These
were written down at the time in a notebook. The picture dates
were estimated long after the fact, during the 35mm scanning
process, sometimes without reference to notes. In those days
35mm slides, unlike digital images, had only the much later
processing date printed on the mount.

<BR clear='all'><P> <B>August 17 - Wednesday</B>
<BR>Odometer: 132776.
<BR>Depart: 10:21 from St. Catharines.
<BR>Arrive : 19:46 at Chutes P.P., Ontario.
<BR>St. Catharines to Tobermory in 4:33 hrs.

<BR clear='all'><P>  A squeaky beginning.  We park the car and dawdle in the gift
shops of Tobermory, nearly losing our place in line for the
ferry.  We sprint the last hundred yards and roar on board the
Chi-Chi-Maun, Big Fire Canoe. The deckhands divert us up some
impossible gangway leading to the ceiling of the hold. The hood
of the car points at a maze of pipes and wires in the roof; I
can't see if I'm driving into the car ahead of me. A hydraulic
mechanism hoists the whole gangway into the air with us and the
car on it.  We make our escape to the upper decks.

<BR clear='all'><P>       The weather is cold and foggy; we huddle in the lounge
on the way across eating sandwiches, and drinking coffee. We
compare the service to the B.C. ferry system (favourably) and
discuss personal origins (mine - less favourably). Egotistical, but
appropriate, since James Fielding is a creature of MY ego and we
are supposed to be tracing HIS origins.  Or is it OUR
origins, and that raises the question of whether every journey
eventually becomes an inner journey. At this point, my alter ego
and I are still not completely convinced we'll succeed in
reaching our destination, the distances are so great. He faces
months of canoeing and riding; I face the miles behind the wheel
of an ageing station wagon. At times, I wonder if Fielding and
his friends have begun to take on a life of their own, luring
their creator to his ruin. And then we enter harbour at South
Baymouth and all the passengers make a rush for their cars. 

 <BR clear='all'><P>      At one leap, we've taken off from Upper Canada and
landed on the frontier.  Driving north across the island, we
reach the sheltered North Channel, the old canoe route running
east and west between the mainland and Manitoulin Island.
Immediately following the war, in 1815 and after, the North
Channel was the subject of intensive marine surveys by Owen,
Bayfield and others.  To the young Fielding, these men were
heroes, braving the elements to produce reliable charts and
shoreline sketches. They mapped a route that extended from the
mouth of the French River to the Falls of St. Mary's, present
day Sault Ste. Marie. 
 <BR clear='all'><P>      We camp at Chutes Provincial Park.

<BR clear='all'><P> <B>August 18 - Thursday</B>
<BR>Odometer: 133090
<BR>Depart: 7:40
<BR>Arrive : 19:20 at Sibley P.P., Ont.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We spend the day making milage past Sault Ste. Marie and
along the north shore of Lake Superior.  A pause in Marathon
to replenish fuel and groceries and to recall our hike on the
Pukasaw Trail in 1981.  On that trip, we discovered the scene
of the confrontation between James, Mrs Maidstone and
Mr Maidstone which resulted in James having to remove a pistol ball
from Maidstone's shoulder by the light of a campfire.

<BR clear='all'><P> See the following chapter of The Scarlet Thread. However. I
must admit that this chapter was written, or at least
elaborated, after camping on a certain secluded beach on the
Lake Superior shore. The previous paragraph might better have
said that we discovered the location "that was to become the
scene of the confrontation." See also the Pukasaw hike web page.

</B><BR><A href="chap4d.htm?zoom_highlight=" target="_parent">Reluctant Surgeon</A>


<BR clear='all'><P>      The road to the north of Lake Superior is a driver's
dream. But you need quick reflexes and a sharp eye for scenic
stopping places, or you won't get any pictures. You'll be
relentlessly pursued by leadfooted drivers who will stop at
nothing to pass in the teeth of oncoming traffic. There's
frequently a real problem of how to pull over safely or to cross
to a parking area on the opposite side of the highway without
risking an accident. 

<BR clear='all'><P>      The park at Sibley is 30 kilometres from Hwy 17 and
down a winding sideroad.  We have a swim after supper at dusk,
off a fine, sandy beach where the water is warm and clear.
Heavy rain and an electrical storm liven up the night.  We're
beginning to notice things forgotten in the rush to get away:
matches, can and bottle openers, pocket knife.


<BR clear='all'><P> <B>August 19 - Friday</B>
<BR>Odometer: 133656
<BR>Depart: 8:45
<BR>Arrive : 19:30  at Rushing River P.P., Ont.
<BR>Add 1 hour to elapsed time for crossing a time zone.

<BR clear='all'><P>      Before leaving Sibley, we drive to the end of the
peninsula.  Opposite Silver Island is a historic site, something
about a silver mine, which makes sense.  But the fog is thick
and time is short so we decide against a hike to Thunder Cape
and the Sleeping Giant. It was while rounding this cape that Mrs
Maidstone and James said what they thought were their final
goodbyes.  It was here that she gave him that handkerchief
embroidered with a rose done in scarlet thread which was to have
such fatal consequences in the months ahead.

tied up at the quayside. We watch "Simon Fraser" depart from the

river. Off to the side of the fort, is an Indian camp with
demonstrations of crafts and cooking. 

<BR clear='all'><P>      We stay from 10:30 in the morning to 2:30 in the

<BR clear='all'><P>       Entering Manitoba, the transition between woods and
grasslands is a genuine surprise to the Ontario resident.  
We're driving through forested country while I look down to
study the map. (Merle driving.) Looking up again, the land is
level to the horizon, dotted only with clusters of aspen
surrounding distant farmsteads. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       We skirt Winnipeg, towering in the distance, via a
network of convenient bypass roads. The site where the Ames
Expedition camped, on the west bank of the Red River, near old
Fort Douglas and the junction of the Assiniboine, is buried deep
under urban renewal. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Heading down the Red River, a margin of trees lines its
bank, with willows common, today a dark, wet green, contrasting
with the harvested grain fields. Crossing over to the east bank:
stubble to the horizon, a thin line of distant trees, drizzle
and grey overcast.  A few fields of sunflowers impersonate the
proverbial huddled masses of marxist theory; their yellow petals
are fallen; they stand shoulder to shoulder, eyeless faces all
staring after some invisible leader. 


<BR clear='all'><P>       A stop on the banks of the Red River to reconnoitre
those scenes where Fielding and Harris followed the track of Mr.
Maidstone. Crossing a harvested field for a better look at the
river, I discover the incredible black soil of the area. It
cakes onto my sandals to form a pair of overshoes made of thick
mud. This is the same soil the fur traders swore up and down was
no good for agriculture.  On the river bank, is a vine with
pointed leaves and bunches of pink flowerlets on a stem.  I'm
sure that somewhere James Fielding made a note of it in his
diary for later identification.  In 1816, he was a better
botanist than I, who in 1983 has all the resources of "A Field

<BR clear='all'><P> It's hardly the place to discuss mystical transports.
But this non-descript river bank is the site of one of the
strongest experiences of my all-too inconclusive career as a
fiction writer. I'd set important scenes of The Scarlet
Thread on this very site, which I'd never previously visited,
or even seen pictures of. Imagination had constructed an
environment of low, muddy banks, with lines of trees and
floodplain prairie fields in back. A horse and rider could
enter the water and swim across fairly safely here. To
encounter a nearly identical situation on this visit seemed
almost uncanny.

<BR clear='all'><P> Somewhere along the right bank Colonel Enright made his camp. A very damp
Ensign Fielding and Midshipman Harris spied on them from the marshy, bushy
banks you see above.

<BR clear='all'><P> A few drops of rain plop into the water, interrupting my muddy
reverie. Some more pictures and we drive on. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Passing through Pembina on the U.S. border, we
inspect the junction of the Pembina River and the Red.  The
muddy banks are backed up with modern levees to restrain the
floodwaters. At the forks is a half-hearted historical display
and a log house in the park. The setting is nondescript but
it's odd how the terrain and the weather are largely as I'd
imagined. Fielding and Harris would have ridden along behind a
screen of riverbank trees, attempting to keep an eye on
Maidstone.   They would have been compelled to ford a river
that was higher in June than in August, but the same muddy
banks and murky water that disgusted the fastidious Harris are
visible today.  I feel close to my characters in this
unlikely place.

<BR clear='all'><P> We drive west to where the banks of the Pembina, not much more
than a pastoral stream in its upper reaches, would have provided
that meadow where Col. Enright made his stop. There he laid his
plans with Maidstone and waited for the advantageous moment to
move out across the prairie to intercept the track of Captain
Ames's British party, soon to depart from the vicinity of old Fort
Douglas, near the centre of present-day Winnipeg.

Sioux and where they witnessed that skirmish which led to the

<BR clear='all'><P> At Turtle Mountain Park we make camp.  The
Turtle Mountains are an islolated area of hills and lakes in the
south-west corner of Manitoba, near the U.S. border.  The many
ponds have a numerous population of turtles and this is how the
region got its name. At one time, the area supported a haying
industry on the rich meadows within the forest. 

<BR clear='all'><P> The park doesn't have many patrons this season and we
have a wide choice of campsites. Smearing ourselves generously
with insect repellent, we walk along an excercise trail and end
up at a marshy lake where there's a dammed-up section for
swimming, a playground and a change room. It's cloudy and cool
and we nearly freeze while swimming.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Leaving Turtle Mountain park, we vist the
International Peace Garden straddling the border. This is filled
with scenic drives, spacious gardens and a soaring monument
in the centre, which has, for me, strange echoes of Vimy Ridge.
A long drive in, and then a long drive out. Much ado about
what?

<BR clear='all'><P> The grand old Duke of York,
<BR>He had ten thousand men.
<BR>He marched them up to the top of the hill,
<BR>And he marched them down again.

<BR clear='all'><P>       What is the real purpose of this place?  There seems to
be nothing to "do" here. It lies on a road between Outer
Manitoba and Inner North Dakota which must see very little
except local traffic. You would think the people who live nearby
would have more practical things on their minds. Perhaps
tourists go out of their way to come here. If so, there must be
something everybody knows but me.   The main reason we stopped
in the neighbourhood was to camp in the provincial park next
door and to view the Turtle Hills themselves. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Perhaps this park is the "floral clock" of Manitoba.
Every day, in the tourist season near Niagara Falls, you see
tour buses and crowds congregating at the floral clock on the
Niagara Parkway. In the throng are quite a few foreigners. But
you might wonder why someone would come all the way from
Yokahama to make a point of posing his family in front of a
raised flower bed laid out in the shape of a clock face.
Somehow, certain items on the tourist itinerary become
"hardwired" into the guidebook program; no one knows why they're
there any more, but you're not allowed to push the "stop"
button till you've completed the entire list.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Speaking of practical matters: today is Sunday; we have to
cross the border; the local gas station is closed and we're
nearly empty.  The range of our behemoth station wagon, even at
a modest cruising speed, leaves much to be desired.   I estimate
it will do about 320 miles on a tankful, but this isn't quite
far-ranging enough for touring off the arterial roads,
especially if you allow for going short early on a Sunday
morning.  Nevertheless, we press on across the border and
soon find gasoline on the other side of the hills, somewhere in
North Dakota.

<BR clear='all'><P>       The Turtle Hills extend over the border. Going south,
you find yourself on a height of land overlooking the approaches
to the Missouri country.   When you get down onto the plains and
look back, you can still glimpse that blue ridge of wet hills in
the north which heralds the 49th parallel.  In historical times,
this was recognised as the threshold of British North America.
A subtle transition nudges you into a sense of anticipation:
colours are now beginning to shift from blue-green to brown,
but it's still not clear what changes in the landscape are in
store for the south- and west-bound traveller.

        At a gas station we find a marvelous junk sculpture.

head looks back at the Turtle Hills, bobbing contentedly to the
whirr of intestinal machinery, quietly digesting old rubber

<BR clear='all'><P>       We reach the valley of the Missouri.
But before we can see the river itself, a subtle impression of
greater visibility to the south, of the land sloping down to
some basin beyond the line of sight. Then the lake formed by the
Garrison Dam comes into view.  We drive alongside the lake for a
bit. Above the dam, Lake Sakakawea innundates the valley up to
the level of the surrounding tableland. But further west, and
now down below us, is the great river celebrated by balladeers
and story-tellers: majestic bluffs on either side, rich bottom
land, a massive flow of water between banks lined with
cottonwood and willow.

follow the rolling bluffs of the old river bank west, and
eventually find a modest signpost pointing to a very
ordinary-looking bit of pasturage. Beside the entrance to this
property, is a mobile home which is the headquarters of the
attendant.  We drive along a track through the grass and come to
the edge of the bank where we park at an interpretive booth.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We examine the ground. Here and there are small piles of
bleached bones, whether gathered by treasure-hunters, rodents or
archaeologists, you can't tell; the soil is rich with fragments
of white, the substance of generations of animals and men -- the
knuckle bones, ribs and vertebrae of those forgotten
predecessors who have left no descendants.  The buffalo are
gone, the raised burial platforms of the Indians are gone; the
Mandans are gone, exterminated by disease, some of their last
tribal lands innundated under the headpond of the Garrison dam.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We chat with the young man who maintains the site. He
provides useful bibliographical references and the suggestion
that we visit other sites in the vicinity.  Further north along
the riverbank, at Cut Knife Creek, is the site of a Hidatsa
village, another tribe of the region, also dwelling in earth
lodges. Here there's an interpretive centre and an earth lodge
recreated to scale. In the yard of the interpretive centre,
members of the buckskin fraternity will demonstrate the frontier
crafts of leather tanning, black powder shootin' while dressed
in period costume. Can hardly wait.

<BR clear='all'><P>       A stroll to the bank of the Missouri.  The relentless
flood that would have passed this point in historical times has
long receded.  Today the actual riverbank is a half mile
distant; below me is a boggy mass of reeds and a few sluggish
streams.  The river lies hidden beyond a line of distant
cottonwoods.

<BR clear='all'><P>       I look for recognisable features. The bank comes to a
point, jutting out over the damp thickets below. Scrambling down
into the underbrush and struggling out into the open, I
can now see the bank in profile.  It's an effort to imagine the underbrush
stripped away, and the Missouri rolling past the high bluff where I
stood a moment before.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Time to  press through the reeds and struggle back up the bank,
up a certain cleft in the old shoreline that seems oddly
familiar.  On an open field where the grass has been mowed, Merle and I
trace out the circular depressions of vanished lodges.  It was on the
roofs of these vanished lodges that the visiting white men sat
on the first day of their visit as they looked out over the
village, meditating on the amazing scene about them.

<BR clear='all'><P>        In the centre of a cluster of these circular depressions is an open
space; near its edge is one particular circle, perhaps a little larger than
the others. So it was here, I imagine, that James Fielding witnessed the
initiation rituals of the Okipa.  In an earth lodge on this circle where I
now stand, the youths were hoisted skyward, toward the roof opening, by ropes
attached to skewers piercing the flesh of their pectoral muscles.

From somewhere up there, in the territory of the buffalo, Lone
Man would have appeared to make his way down to the village at
the start of the Okipa ritual.

have been there that he located the exhausted boy and protected him from

<BR clear='all'><P>       Late in the afternoon, we drive to the south end of the
Garrison dam and cross northward. Taking the Lewis and Clark Route west,
Highway 1804, we seek out a campsite for the night among the
badlands on the north shore of Lake Sakakawea.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Our way back toward British territory takes us on
Route 1804, the Lewis and Clark Route, along the north side of
Lake Sakakawea. Soon, we see the badlands of those streams that
feed the Missouri from the north. The lake didn't exist in
historical times; it is entirely a creation of the Garrison Dam.
The typical prospect in those days would have been a wide
valley with high bluffs; down whose centre the river once
flowed, rolling past groves of willow. In the far distance, to
the south and southwest, we see a few of those flat-topped
buttes which give such a characteristic profile to wild-west
horizons.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Arriving at Lewis and Clark State Park near dusk, we're
unable to decipher the complex instructions at the self-service
entrance, and in desperation, we move right in and made
ourselves at home.  Eventually a ranger comes to collect the fee
and sell firewood.  The park also seems to be a centre for
boating on Lake Sakakawea.  We hear the sounds of revelry in a
small craft anchored off shore.  This is not a native craft,
Merle reminds me, harkening back to an inadvertant craft show
pun I may never live down.

<BR clear='all'><P>       A full moon hangs over the badlands on the opposite
shore; we make our fire on the ground, cowboy style, in a
circular firepit. This is one of the few places that doesn't
have the elaborate and self-consciously rustic fireplaces
usually favoured in woodland campsites. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Today we've made a definite transition, and I suspect
that Fielding, Harris and the others would have sensed the same
thing on their way past this point in 1816.  You do get an
impression of "the plains" as soon as you leave behind the
forests of the Laurentian Shield in eastern Manitoba, but you
have to come this far to encounter that peculiarly "western"
combination of dryland prairie, badlands and rolling plains.
Farms become ranches; green pastures and cultivated fields merge
into rangeland; valleys become gulleys. It is the edge of a new
kind of landscape extending all the way south to the cactus
country and beyond into Mexico.

<BR>Add one hour due to crossing a time zone.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Today we leave the Missouri, driving north through
Williston and Plentywood and up Big Muddy Creek.  This was the
probable route of the Ames Expedition as they made their way toward the
height of land between the Missouri and the South Saskatchewan
Rivers.  The valley floor is wide and level; there would have
been sufficient water and pasturage for horses.  On either side,
we see the eroded bluffs mentioned in the expedition's log.  At
the entrance to one of those valleys, over on the right, lies
the spot where James Fielding found signs of Colonel Enright's
passage and made the gruesome discovery of a victim of "frontier
justice". 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Just north of the 49th parallel, we turn west through
the wheat farms.  Finding water would have been the main problem
for an overland trek along the border. Although there is some
drainage going south to the Missouri, the creeks at their
headwaters are sluggish, particularly in high summer. A
westering party of horsemen might have to carry sufficient
drinking water for several days. But, at least, the badlands are
not extensive enough to present any serious obstacle to
movement.  Our chosen road climbs a succession of ridges
separating the basin of one stream from another and then drops
down again into the next valley, revealing long views of wheat
fields mixed with rangeland in the rougher areas. To the south,
across the width of a single farm, lies the international
border. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       It rains in the early afternoon and we have lunch at the
side of the road, dining on our usual picnic of sliced meat,
lettuce, tomatoes and chunks of cheese.   Merle says it makes
her feel deliciously guilty for not stopping to prepare a
"proper" meal. And all the while, I thought we were eating
proper meals. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The Cypress Hills are a forested area straddling the
Saskatchewan-Alberta border and lie some miles north of the
49th parallel.  An overland exploring party moving west could
have stopped here to hunt, to find good water and pasturage, and
to overlook the surrounding plains. The Ames Expedition had the
special task of evaluating the military potential of any
prominent natural features. These hills could have played an
important role as a staging point or a secure rallying place in
the advent of further hostilities with the Americans.  Whoever
controlled these hills would probably also control the South
Saskatchewan River.  But there was another over-riding reason
for being there:  the Enright Overland Expedition was also
in the area and preparing to enter Blackfoot country. The
Colonel had ventured considerably above the 49th parallel, to
sniff out the territory north of the Missouri basin in the
interests of an ambitious Jeffersonian continentalism. A policy
that might have led to the whole Northwest becoming part of the
USA.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Neither group, as yet, had any reason to regard the 49th
parallel as a forgone conclusion.  You may recall that the Ames
Expedition was none too reticent about crossing the line in the
opposite direction, in order to visit the Mandan villages, and
these were situated on the banks of the Missouri itself, but had
traditionally been serviced by traders from the north.

<BR clear='all'><P> From a certain, more forward, British point of view, the
American Louisiana Purchase comprised only the basin of the
Mississippi River, excluding the Missouri. A piece of wishful
thinking, which, if successful, might have eventually made the
Missouri country, as well as the entire Pacific Northwest, a
British possession. However, to claim a territory on the basis
of obscure legality and fuzzy geography is one thing; to possess
it quite another.  This was a point well-understood by the
elder Captain Fielding and the astute Admiral Fisher.  To
possess a territory you must, at the very least, enter it,
traverse it, drive your tent pegs into its soil.

Saskatchewan, and that evening set out to explore. At dusk, from
a lookout on a high mound, we see orange light outlining
badlands and hills far away to the west and north.  The hill we
stand on is built entirely of pebbles and, in fact, the entire
range consists of an enormous gravel deposit laid down in
glacial times. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Inching along the dusty park roads in the dark, we
encounter our first "texas gate" - a sort of cattle barrier in
the road, a culvert bridged over with spaced iron pipes. A car
can be driven slowly across this contraption, but cattle avoid
it for fear of putting their feet down the slots.

passable only in good weather; we're intrigued. Can this aging
station wagon aspire to high adventure and find a new life for
itself as a Land-Rover?   That night, to be sure of an early
start, we fill up with gas at a station in the park and are
informed by the attendant, "Some guys I knew went in there once
(knew, past tense, ominous pause). Yup.  Had to haul 'em out
with a four-wheel drive - broken axle (sigh). Need yer oil

surroundings come to stand for a wider reality. A "Travellers on
the Path of Life", sort of metaphor. I've heard it argued that
parkland itself is genetically coded into human preferences,
perhaps from our primordial days in East Africa. Broad, open, rolling
spaces, punctated by patches of woodland, threaded by lakes and
rivers, roamed by animals. People were asked in a survey what
sort of landscape they preferred: desert, shoreline, forest,
mountains, flat plains, ice and snow. Many, a majority possibly,
apparently showed a preference for just the sort of landscape we
see today.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Driving west through the Cypress Hills, we reach the highest point in
the whole region.  It looks out on a stunning prospect over the plains to the
north and west, all the way to the South Saskatchewan River. Still no sight
of the Rockies. This leg of the Ames Expedition's journey, dropping down out
of the hills toward the valley of the river, was the occasion of
the death of the interpreter Bonnechance. After this incident, the expedition
members looked toward the plains with increased trepidation, knowing they had
to traverse the whole territory of the Blackfoot and Blood Nations.  We drive
north-west to Medicine Hat, a far less intimidating prospect. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The site of the expedition's encounter with the Blood Indians is
likely around here. According to the "record", the incident took place some
half-day's ride south of the river, in a shallow ravine off a minor tributary
of the South Saskatchewan. Along the south side of the valley near Medicine
Hat, there is a bluff, something like the one on the Missouri at the
Mandan village. Could this be it? Driving southwest again from
Medicine Hat toward Lethbridge, the land rises gradually, but we cross few
ravines suggesting the siege that consumed the bulk of the expedition's
black powder and nearly resulted in a massacre. One can only hope that some
local historian will have the initiative to better scout out the area until
the exact location is found.

above, sharp-edged crags, swept bare of soil; to the easterner,
a new revelation of geology.  Remember, we've hardly

even the badlands of the Missouri had more the character of
eroded earth.

village is overwhelming; the brow of the cliff still dominates
the valley, still meditating ruin. At the top of the pass is the
site of a recent forest fire, with interpretive trails providing
a cautionary lesson to the visitor. The pass itself is
disappointing: too low and too easy to have been the one taken
by the Ames Expedition. I'm surprised by the continuous
settlement and industry on the way through; it's an
old-established coal-mining area. With all the historical fuss
over Crow's Nest Pass freight rates, you might expect a tortuous
ascent in low gear up steep winding roads and through dank
tunnels.  But instead of a route built at an untold cost in
lives and treasure, you have a broad corridor providing an easy
path to the B.C. interior with, on the road at least, only very modest grades. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Had it not been for Colonel Enright's navigation
error, following the interception of that spurious heliograph
message, supposedly from Maidstone, the pass would have been put

construction days. The peculiar thing is, that the discovery of

steamboats once plied this river, coming from as far south as
Montana. At the head of the river is a marshy lake which is
connected to the river by a channel known as McGillivray's
Portage[?].  At one time a steamboat was able to get through
here but the route was scuttled by international disagreement on
water levels. The lake also drains north into the Columbia, and
since the Kootenay is a tributary of the Columbia, this means
that a vast tract of interior B.C. and the adjoining
American state is, in effect, an island in the Columbia River.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Somewhere to the west, lies that high pass which both the Enright
Overland Expedition and the Ames Expedition crossed to reach the interior.
Somewhere on the shores of this lake lies the ruin of that fort temporarily
occuppied by Colonel Enright following his desperate escape across the
mountains. The exact locations of the Colonel's grave and the rickety
palisade which he attempted to defend against the attack of disgruntled
Kootenay Indians have not yet been discovered. It was here that James
Fielding was nearly lynched by Enright's desperate men and where, by the
intervention of Catherine Maidstone (nee Montague), the execution was stayed
and the victim launched on an extraordinary career as an American popular
hero.

giving rides to the kiddies.  The illusion evaporates; memory

good to be true; below the terrace is a waterfall; above it
looms the long, even flank of Mt. Rundle, an upraised slab of
rock, terminating in a sheer drop. You can watch climbing
adventures (or tragedies) from your hotel room window. Mt.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Halfway down the lake, the clouds begin to lift, revealing
tantalising glimpses of the lower flanks of the surrounding
peaks.  Reaching the far end of the lake, the
tops of these peaks begin to peep out through tatters of
cloud, so we continue walking. So far, the path has
been wide and smooth; beyond this, it climbs upward, following
the valley of that glacial brook which feeds Lake Louise. 

<BR clear='all'><P>      The teahouse, apparently, is still miles ahead, but we're
wearing hiking boots and soon outdistance the more bourgeois
pedestrians keeping to the path beside the lake. You think of a
tea house as a place frequented by aunties with blue veins on
the backs of their hands, and the bouquet on the tea table would
be woodland violets, not edelweiss.  But the path climbs higher
and higher through woods and up along the side of the valley. 

<BR clear='all'><P> Down in its ravine, the placid brook now foams its way to Lake
Louise between high banks of piled stone, the ruins of glacial
moraines and ancient rockfalls.  Far ahead, the highest
icefields glitter, now exposed to view as the last banners of
cloud are torn loose by the breeze.  A distant crash stops us in
our tracks.  We're unable to place the exact origin of the
sound: blasting operations? a sonic boom, perhaps.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We continue up the track.  In the valley to our
left, the brook is now flanked by two steep ridges of glacial
debris, lateral moraines, thrust aside by the glacier hundreds
or thousands of years ago and, today, still clear of any
vegetation.  Leaving the trail, I'm able to get down to the
nearer ridge and tramp along the knife-edge where there's a
path of sorts.  Merle continues on up the approved route to the
tea house with a party of other hikers.

<BR clear='all'><P> My own path leads up the
valley past fields of stony debris toward the edge of the
glacier. The transition from gravel to ice is gradual.  On my
left, the snout of the nearest glacier is so melted and covered
with debris as to seem a part of the valley floor. I scramble up
the razor-back of the moraine to a point where I can look down
into a giant fissure. In the depths of the glacier, the ice
shines blue-green.

<BR clear='all'><P>       At the highest point on the moraine, Lake Louise is
still visible, back down the valley. The hotel can just barely
be picked out on the opposite side of the lake. Here
the spine of the moraine is quite sharp, and while shakily
replacing the film in my camera, I'm aware there's a non-zero
risk of plummeting down the gravel bank onto the glacier below. 
Next, a very careful turn-around, arms at the ready for balance.
At my back, the valley expands into a wide cirque where 5 (count
them, 5) glaciers can be seen at once. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Time to leave the moraine to rejoin Merle at the tea
house. This must be somewhere above me, one would think, above
the trees on the side of the valley. Fighting up through dense
thickets of waist-high spruce bushes, and reaching a vantage
point, I cast about for signs of civilization. The gound is
running with tiny streams; everywhere there's a gurgle of
decending rivulets among the stones. Hmmm, a nice pot of tea,
brewed from the water of some sparkling mountain freshet, would
be about right just now. But where's the tea house? A moment's
confusion, not quite panic.

<BR clear='all'><P> Finally, a vestigial trail leading
ever higher up into the mountains. No tea house.  A few more
moment's unease. What would Baden-Powell do, lost in the
mountains, no tea and no wife to wescue him. Then I realize that
I've overshot, in my moraine exploration, that paths are
bidirectional things, to be wisely followed backward, down to
the highest patch of forest on the shoulder of the valley.  Here
the tea house is conveniently located, amid sheltering trees, and
there's Merle waiting at the end of the trail that comes up from
the lake.

<BR clear='all'><P>       It's an alpine-style stone building with an overhanging
balcony on the second floor.  We find a table on the balcony and
order soup, sandwiches and tea. Then, feast our eyes on the
view, our stomachs on the food. You meet quite a variety of
interesting people in this sort of place; the challenge and the
scenery seem to bring out a slightly eccentric and good-natured
kind of individual.  Or is this simply a case of "rapture of the
heights", a condition that sometimes afflicts perfectly normal,
surly individuals? The first symptom is that you begin to say
"howdy" or "g'day mate" a lot, and experience little difficulty
in speaking to strangers.  Then you start grinning idiotically
and begin to feel you're partners with everyone you meet, in
some splendid mountaineering enterprise.  Another thing:
everyone seems to come from some obscure and far-away place.  
But this is obviously a delusion, since the odds against meeting
two people on a mountain top, from Melbourne and Semipalatinsk at the
same time, are one in 8.26 times 10 to the 7th power. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Over lunch, someone reveals that the trail continues
further up the valley to an even higher vantage point. Full of
glycogen, we decide to follow it.

<BR clear='all'><P> But first, after lunch, you have to toss a few crumbs to the marmot
sitting on a rock outside the tea house; he's the local
toll-booth keeper, collecting scraps of food from hikers.
Marmots have a whistling call that you can't mistake for any
other animal. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The trail is now well above the treeline and all that
remains of the forest are stands of low bushes in a few
protected locations.  We pass an area where the scrub trees
beside the trail have been stripped of bark and foliage; the
peeled stems pointing downward into the ravine. I begin to
understand the origin of those mysterious rumblings and distant
crashes we have been hearing all morning. Slicing downward, an
avalanche must had passed by here last winter at just about our
present head level.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Resting under the cliff, we're a little awestruck by the
view, and stare up at the glacier hanging down from Abbott Pass.
Visible at the top, is a hut maintained by the Alpine Club of
Canada and normally reached from the opposite side. Beside this
hut is the highest privy in Canada.  Since it rests on the Great
Divide, you have the honour of knowing, when you use it, that
you've contributed to the enrichment of the both the Pacific
and Arctic Oceans. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       On the right and towering overhead is a sheer cliff
topped by a glacier. In places, ice hangs over the edge.  A
startling concussion rivets our attention. Somewhere above, the
icefield fractures in the heat of noonday and a cloud of
fragments rattles down the cliff face a few hundred yards away.
In the background, a continuous rush of falling water. Behind
us and up a slope of loose rock, a waterfall is fed by the
same ice field, plunging off the top of the cliff and rushing
down the side of the moraine. We climb to the base of the
waterfall, selecting every toehold with care and taking extra
precautions not to dislodge stones. I'm conscious that we've
attained the modest limit of our climbing experience and can go
no further. Reaching the cascade, we satisfy our thirst by
drinking melt water running directly out of the glacier and into
our mouths.

<BR clear='all'><P>       The highway up the Sunwapta Pass provides the most
exciting piece of automotive mountain climbing we've done
to date. Plenty of switchbacks to provide a challenge
to the car's cooling system and lookouts where you can park and peer
over the edge to exclaim, "Did we really come from way down
there?". The top is well above the treeline and serves
as a jumping-off point to hikes on the high alpine meadows. At
last, we may have found a model for that pass over which Colonel
Enright was compelled by bad weather and hostile Natives to
flee in disarray.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Arriving at Glacier Camp, which is just the other
side of the pass, we pitch our tent.   Right away, you can
tell this is a camping spot of a different sort:  lots of
low-slung, alpine tents, women with braids, men with checked
flannel shirts, beards and great knobbly boots.   As they
unpack their gear I can see long coils of nylon kernmantel rope and
hear the clink of climbing iron-mongery. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Standing around the campfire in a drizzle, we discuss
the prospects with our fellow mountaineers. Nothing can depress
me in a place like this. No longer hemmed-in by
mountains, we're up among the summits on a footing of equality
with the high peaks. This is the base camp of a march into a new and
unfamiliar territory. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       We meet a student from Switzerland on vacation. What
else would a Swiss on vacation do but go and look at somebody
else's alps?  He's hitched a ride from California with an
American and they've just arrived by motorcycle, shortly after
we've taken the last campsite. Never mind, always room for
another member of the brotherhood. The motorcyclist has ideas
about doing a little climbing in the morning and soon joins
forces with our neighbour in the adjoining campsite. They huddle
around the campfire and plan an early morning assault on Mt.
Athabaska. Out of self-defense, I'm forced to discuss
computers, reverting to my backup identity. Just before turning
in, I happen to look up into the drizzle and notice a single
star, directly overhead.

the freezing point. The tents are pitched on wooden platforms to
compensate for irregularities in the site.  I toss and turn,
having grown used to a mattress of springy turf or pine needles.
The campsite is in deep shadow in the morning. On looking out of
the tent, the sky is blue and nearly cloudless, inviting a
stroll round the campsite. Mt. Athabaska, is visible in the
distance behind an intervening ridge; a dazzling light reflected
from its icefields. A bottle of water left outdoors last night
is partially frozen and one of the picnic tables is covered with
a sheet of glare ice.

invite us to hike up to the Athabaska Glacier with them.  This
is the point where they'll set out on the final leg of their
climb. We wolf down granola in the frosty air, pack our gear
and set out. The approach to the mountain is located up a side
road not far from the point where the glacier tours set out. We
park the cars down in the flats below the glacier (still far
above the treeline) and set out through meadows of Alpine
flowers. The climbers' access path soon strikes off the road and
wanders up a lateral moraine leading to the foot of the glacier.
As we ascend, pausing frequently to get our wind, the whole
valley begins to open up and the parking lot shrinks to the
point where we have to use binoculars to see the car.

steep uphill walking, we're faced with an energetic scramble up
a slope of earthy debris guarded at the top by a bristling
protrusion of the underlying rock. We pass this
obstruction using whatever chancy holds we can find on the
rotten cliff, taking care not to start an avalanche. Past the
barrier, we continue up the moraine to the edge of the glacier
where it meets the solid flank of the mountain. Behind us, in
case you weren't noticing, Merle, the view has grown more stunning
with every foot of altitude gained.  Now you can focus your
eagle's eyes far across the valley to that high, distant pass, hidden
from ordinary birds down below, and there will we build our

gallop down the other side and begin to organize equipment
at the foot of the glacier. Breaking the ice of a pool of melt
water, they fill canteens while we sit and watch.  The
preparations seem to take a long time, to carefully adjust
straps, repack rucksacks and put on down vests. At length
everything is ready. Standing in deep shadow, they face a steep
wall of melting ice before they can even reach the surface of
the glacier. Tiptoeing up the wall on the points of  crampons,
they hack footsteps as they go. At the top, a pause to wave good
bye, on a level again with our own position as we sit opposite
them on the top of the moraine. Their climb well-begun, they set
off across a mile-wide sheet of hard ice, probing the surface
with ice axes. On the far side the surface slopes more steeply
upward, providing a ramp that will give  access to the summit of
the mountain.

just barely balanced by my fear of falling two thousand feet straight
down. Below is the main glacier. Buses with caterpillar tracks
crawl across the surface taking tourists out onto the icesheet.
A view like this confers a feeling of privilege - seeing from a
great height without being seen - the affairs of ordinary
citizens laid out for critical inspection.

<BR clear='all'><P>       On the opposite side of the valley, we spy out routes
for future hikes. A certain high pass, saddle-shaped,
is almost a model for the pass where the Ames Expedition
camped while following the track of Colonel Enright over the
Great Divide. There's even a peak which overlooks the pass on
one side and the main valley on the other.  It was from such a
peak that James and Harris saw through their telescope the Stars
and Stripes flying over the Colonel's camp near the headwaters
of the Columbia.

<BR clear='all'><P>       From the parking lot at the bottom, I train my
binoculars on the glacier for the last time.  Far above the
highest point that we reached, I glimpse two figures near
the top of the Athabaska icefield and moving steadily upward. Our
companions have reached a position that will give
them access to the summit via the highest ridges of the peak.  A
plume of drifting snow sweeps past them, but they continue
steadily upward.  Down in the parking lot, it's beginning to
get hot and the eyepieces of my binoculars fog up, still
chilled, I suppose, from the cold of the glacier. I look
again, but the two figures have vanished into a world of their
own. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       On to Jasper.  I discover while mailing film that I've overexposed
the last two rolls with the camera set at the wrong film speed; this as the
result of being sold Kodachrome 64 instead of Kodachrome 25 in Banff.  For
the rest of the day, I'm too depressed to take a serious interest in
photography. 

<BR clear='all'><P> Editor's note: most of the damage to these pictures has turned out
to be repairable thanks to digital scanning, decades later, plus
intensive PhotoShop treatment.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Rounding Jasper Lake, we notice how the scenery has
changed. The grey peaks have shoulders that seem more rounded;
the spruce trees in the wide valleys have a certain uniform,
grey-green quality that seems less alpine.  Miette's
Rock, almost the last peak before going out onto the foothills,
is mentioned in Paul Kane's account. Here, a certain voyageur
named Miette is supposed to have climbed up on a dare, to sit
with his legs dangling over the edge. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       We drive through Edmonton and continue past to a
campsite at Pembina River.   There, we heat water over the
campfire for sponge baths in the privacy of our tent.

<BR clear='all'><P> Past Edmonton and heading east, the countryside is very
gently rolling with few vistas. At first, forest and a few
farms, and then, further east, more farms and islands of trees,
mostly aspen. The holdings look smaller, more confined than the
spacious ranches and grain farms of the south and west. The soil
is black and the sloughs have a margin of very dark, almost
black reeds. The light itself seems to have a different quality;
the sky is bright overhead, but the colours of the land are
subdued. This is the kind of terrain that reminds me of our
kinship with the Russians.  I slump down in the car seat and do
a Slavic brood on my two lost rolls of film.

<I>83-08-17</I> - <B>Rinse off thoroughly (salt)</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>       A turn south off the main highway to Manitou Lake in
search of a campsite.  When I was a child, my father told me
wondrous tales of swimming in a salt lake somewhere on the
prairies near where he was stationed during the war. Then, more
recently, I read a newspaper article about Manitou Lake and
determine to see it for myself. The town is a seedy remnant of a
once popular resort. Undeterred, we head for the municipal beach
to try out the water. Amazingly buoyant, especially to
someone  used to struggling just to stay afloat in fresh water;
you bob high above the surface without the least effort.  But
after paddling around wide-eyed for a few moments, you begin
wondering what to do next. This is a novelty, for sure, but not a very rich
one; the attention wanders. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       "I wonder what things were like in the old days," says
Merle. "Aunt Pearl talks about the place in disgust."

<BR clear='all'><P>       "Well," say I, "at one time, there was a brine shrimp
fishery on the lake. Quite buoyant too, until the competition
put them under." 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Back on shore, a shower operates
from a tank of cold, fresh water.   We shoo away the children
who are trying to drain it dry for the sheer joy of seeing the
water flow. I flush out the salty water Merle has splashed
in my eyes.  Rinsed clean of mineral deposits, we return to our
campsite.

           Lost an hour. Time zone.

<BR clear='all'><P> Before dawn, the cooing of doves. Then the sun streams into our
tent. Roosters crow on the neighbouring farms. Breakfast free-association:
the water at this campsite is cloudy; the sky too is cloudy, with a high
cirrus, but the coffee is not cloudy today. Home, home on the range, where

<BR clear='all'><P>       Lunch at Saltcoats, Sask., in the village park beside a small lake.  
Sitting at a shady picnic table we watch two young mothers watching a couple
of children play on the swings.  Will little Darlene and young Robert someday
be mommies and daddies who also will sit on a park bench in Saltcoats, Sask.
and watch people watching children play on the swings?

<BR clear='all'><P> Biblical Interlude: The clouds gather, rain falls and the
drops thereof agglomerate into streams; the streams make their
way down, down from the everlasting hills unto which I lift mine
everlovin' eyes; the rivers run into the sea and the sea doth
not runneth over; and from thence the waters return by sweaty
evaporation to the heavens from whence they came. Amen.

<BR clear='all'><P>       The park at Lynch's Point is at the end of
15 kilometers of gravel road and nearly deserted. Only 13
campsites are occuppied out of 100.  But it has beautiful lawns
and a narrow sandy shore, shelving gradually out beyond the
reeds. Foam edges the beach (the natural kind) and we lie
in the shallows revelling in the warm water. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Then a walk out into the marsh where a canal
for launching pleasure boats had been cut through the jungle of
reeds.  Extensive hay fields on the landward side, a few
mosquitoes, and a distant gunshot-like report every few minutes from
some bird-scaring device.  Out on the lake: no land is visible,
no sign of the opposite side, not a sail to be seen, low,
receding shores, green on either hand.  This is the wet prairie,
far from the gullies and sagebrush of the Missouri.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Sitting round the campfire that evening (still burning Parks Canada
firewood from Glacier Camp, Alberta), a seranade by the most incredible whine
of insects in the bushes. At first we try putting fingers in our ears and
swallowing hard in case the sensation is purely internal, a kind of camping
tinnitus. But the sound of the humming occasionally rises and
falls in pitch like a sort of hiccup. Somethimes I can actually trigger this effect by
clapping hands. It challenges the imagination to speculate how these insects can
all hiccup simultaneously.   As it gets dark, we prepare for sleep and the
noise outside the tent seems to grow even louder; difficult to believe the
sound isn't coming from traffic on some busy highway, but we're miles from
the nearest major road.  In spite of the din, we get to sleep and receive
only a few bites.

<BR clear='all'><P> <B>August 30 - Tuesday</B>
<BR>Odometer: 137208
<BR>Depart: 8:13
<BR>Arrive : 17:58  at Inwood P.P., Ontario

<BR clear='all'><P>       We awake to the cooing of doves - a vapid, pallid sort
of music. Why the dove should have been chosen to represent
Peace is beyond me; the sound is soothing but characterless and
verges on the idiotic. How about the tweeting of the Dickey Bird
instead? Now that is sweet. It reminds you of apple-cheeked
girls with pig-tails, gathering flowers and spreading gingham
table cloths for a picnic in the meadow. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The sun rises above the trees and strikes the
dewy grass.  A yellow flower we picked last night on the marsh
is still fresh.  We're the first campsite up and about.

<BR clear='all'><P>       The water is so hard at Lynch's Point that a maelstrom
of chemical reactions erupts in my coffee cup.  The creamer
precipitates out in a vortex, swirling downward to lie at the
bottom of the cup in a disgusting residue. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The humming of the insect choirs that lulled us to sleep is gone. 
Merle dreamed last night that she begot a tiny, wee baby girl and couldn't
remember how to nurse it.  And remembering last night, she couldn't recall
when she'd ever heard insects ROAR.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We load up with supplies in west-suburban Winnipeg, and
after failing to make contact with friends and relatives,
skirt the city via ring roads and head east.  I'm consistently driving too
fast for road conditions and the local speed limits, e.g. 110
when the limit is 90.   But when you have these enormous
milages to cover, the temptation is there; the roads
are good and the traffic is light.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Inwood is an older park and, like many others, not too
heavily used this year. Some of the campsites are very generous
in size, laid out in a helter-skelter arrangement around a lake.
The setting is attractive. Good swimming from a pier and a sandy
beach. During the evening a loon seranades us from out on the
lake.

original site of Fort William. We locate a plaque about 1.2 Km
up the river from its mouth. The approach of canoes coming from
the east across the lake would not have been visible to someone
standing on the boat landing. We drive out to a point at the
mouth of the Kaministiquia River, but Thunder Cape is not quite
visible. From the tip of the breakwater on the left bank, the
belly of the "Sleeping Giant" bears east. From the harbourfront
park in the northern part of the city, Thunder Cape bears almost
due south.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We camp that night at Agawa Bay.  The campground is on
a long, curving shingle beach.  You have to arrive early in
the day to get the best campsites which are just back of the
beach.  In fact, it might be worthwhile to come for several days
and then move to a better campsite on the morning of the second
day, after the exodus has begun and before the afternoon
arrivals. After supper, we go swimming in Lake Superior; the
water is quite comfortable, compared to our Pukasaw trip. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The evening's interpretive program, consists of a
slide show and the film: "Song of the Paddle" (NFB). This is
about a family canoe trip down river to Lake Superior and along
the shore. The film is roughly done, but amusing; almost
a home movie.  A middle-aged, grey-bearded dad likes rough
water and going out on the lake in storms.   Luckily, his kids
are highly skilled at navigating rapids and the waves of Lake
Superior. They lash together two canoes to make a catamaran
and hoist a big spinnaker sail out front.  On shore again, they make
camp and prepare their food amid drenching downpours and
buffeting wind.

similar experience, years later, on this same coastline. See

<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Recap of the Trip</B>

<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Photography:</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>       Used my 28 mm Vivitar wide-angle lens almost
exclusively, with a few telephoto shots of special landscape
features.   It's really inconvenient having to change lenses on
the run; you need a slave to hand you things.  I seem to think
most often in terms of relating elements of the scene together,
rather than in isolating particular features.  Perhaps a 35mm
wide-angle would be better than a 28mm if it is to be the
mainstay.  On looking at the returned pictures, I'm not as
impressed with the lens as I was when using it.  The sharpness
leaves something to be desired (I think) and I have too many
shots with boring foregrounds.
 
<BR clear='all'><P>       The rigid camera bag is too clumsy, maybe something
smaller, with slots for the lenses so things don't get tangled
up. Used the blue Air Force bag, but it's still too clumsy.
Used the tripod ONCE for setting up a time-delay shot so as to
get into a picture with Merle.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Getting in and out of the car gracefully with a camera
round the neck is a challenge.   There's the problem
of disentangling the seat belt and the camera straps.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Made a disastrous error mixing up Kodachrome 64 and
Kodachrome II, forgetting to change the film speed setting.  The
cassettes don't look different enough when you're changing
film in a hurry.  The problem is partly one of using an
unfamiliar camera, Nathan's Canon AT-1, and one I'm not really
happy with. Some of my best pictures in past years were taken
with my old Practica which had no internal metering.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Kodachrome II film is too slow for all-round use.
On cloudy days or in shadowed locations, you're too often up
against shutter speed limitations.   I used the polarizing
screen only once -- too much of a penalty in film speed for
Kodachrome II. The pre-labelled and pre-numbered mailers are a
good idea; they keep the films in order and mailing gets them
out of the way. The first film was already back from processing
by the time we arrived home in St. Catharines. Remember, if you mail
films home over a very long trip, somebody has to pick up the mail,
otherwise you'll have a pile of film out on the front porch
when you return. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       Dust is a problem on back roads.   It infiltrates
absolutely everthing.   All sensitive equipment and materials
must be stored in sealed platic bags.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Need to develop a better way to coordinate notes and
pictures.   It proved really difficult to keep even a simple log
going, let alone a description of every frame in 11 rolls of
36 exposure film.  I found myself speculating about the possiblitiy of tape
recording. This might be a real advantage in a moving car where
writing is difficult at best for a passenger and impossible for
the driver. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       In retrospect, I'm most conscious of the pictures I
failed to take. For instance, a series of banal shots of each
campsite would have been useful, if only as a sort of framework
to help identify and fix each day in the mind.  But of course,
only the spectacular campsites get photographed. Photographic
opportunism becomes the order of the day and continuity suffers.
This points up the need for a script, or, at least, some sort of
organized plan. It could be a complete list of the pictures
required to tell a story, or it might simply be a rough
outline that could be augmented along the way with notes and
references to the pictures already taken. It would then be
clearer, while still in transit, what was missing from the
skeleton narrative. Any glaring omissions could be remedied on
the spot, instead of agonized over when it's too late to go
back and do it over again. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       All this points up the need for a production facility en
route, or some firm committment to keeping a more elaborate note
book, or, possibly, a portable typewriter to compose each day's
rough draft. And, of course, to use a typewriter, even just to
rewrite the day's experiences, would require the time and
conditions to make a job of it: for instance, lighting, and a
less cramped workplace than a backpacker's tent. 


<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Clothing:</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>       I wore about 3 or 4 shirts on the whole trip and one
pair each of trousers and shorts.   Sandals are airy and
comfortable in a hot car, but far from sure-footed when you're
dashing in and out and up and down roadside banks or glacier
moraines to get pictures.
Running shoes are the safest and most comfortable alternative
but they stink. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       We used our hiking boots, kangaroos and rain jackets for
hiking and climbing, even brought along mitts.   What you really
need for climbing are close-fitting, leather-like  gloves, buttoned at
the wrist, tough but comfortable. After hours of clambering over
rock, the hands get sore and lacerated, particularly in the
nippy air above the tree line. 


<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Packs, tents, equipment:</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>       We often used the axe for splitting wood; the saw only
once. The main source of firewood is park woodyards.   The
unsplit cordwood or sawmill scraps -- often all that is available
-- are almost always too thick or too wet to burn, but they're
usually cut into convenient lengths. So what you need is some
way to split the stuff up thin enough to burn. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The tent was adequate for sleeping but we really lived
out of the car. The foam mats are soft under the back but could
be less bulky for easier stowage in transit. A plastic sheet
inside the tent seems to keep the floor reasonably dry in case
of rain or wet ground. However, there was condensation nearly
every night in the sleeping bags and mats. This dried out in the
car with a day's driving.  Of course, if you use inflatable
matresses or other impermeable mats, all the night's
condensation will go into your sleeping bag.   One way or
another, every bit of moisture you exude from sweat or
perspiration must either go outside, through the tent's
ventilation (if any), or condense on the cooler surfaces inside. 

<BR clear='all'><P>       The small rucksack was useful for hiking but still a bit
too small.   I must get a pair of light, internal-frame
rucksacks for the more extended climbs and for those hikes which
fall short of all-in, catch-as-catch-can backpacking.

<BR clear='all'><P>       We slathered ourselves with plenty of mosquito lotion
in Manitoba and it was effective.  Didn't use the first aid kit
or the toolkit more than once or twice:  popped a few aspirins
and used the pliers to bend a wire in Merle's bra. My
calculator/calendar/stopwatch was useful for milage calculations
and keeping track of the date, but it is more vulnerable to
dampness and physical damage than a mechanical watch. 


<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Food:</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>       Great!  Ate out of brown bags and boxes; had sandwiches
every day. It might be convenient to have a picnic hamper or
plywood field kitchen which could be lifted out of the car and
immediately placed on the picnic table. This would also help in
keeping the rear of the car neater. 


<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Planning, general conception:</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>       The trip turned out fairly well for such an impromtu
effort (read: no planning, we just got up and left). The station
wagon is not the most comfortable vehicle for keeping papers and
gear organized while motoring.  Found myself hankering after a
van with bucket seats. It did prove possible to see most of the
locations we wanted and get most of the pictures needed, but it
was very difficult to make notes or keep information organized.

<BR clear='all'><P>       Too much driving, not enough time to observe,
make notes and consider.   It should be possible to write up
something like a finished draft en route while the facts are
still fresh in the memory. This points up the need for a
portable writing desk, a super briefcase, or a portable computer
to help develop a narrative on the spot. (Thought I'd never get
around to computers, eh?) 


<BR clear='all'><P> <B>Car:</B>

<BR clear='all'><P>  The station wagon has sufficient carrying capacity for two
people, but there's a problem with not being able to stow  things
in the car for the duration of the trip and still get at them
easily.  Every day you have to do a fair bit of unpacking and
repacking.   The bucket seats of a van would make it easier to
get at the things in back.   It would also be nice if the
vehicle contained a place to sit at a level surface to read, write or
prepare food, especially when it was necessary to work inside in
case of bad weather or other reason.  A crie-de-coeur: the slick
plastic seats of our station wagon are particularly ghastly in
sweaty weather; we must cover them with something absorbent.

the ingenuity of the staff at the local Department of Public
Works.  They're often quite original.  Lewis and Clark State
Park, N.D. had a section of metal pipe sunk in the ground to
simulate a campfire on the priarie.   In Manitoba we had
square cookers with hinged grills.  In Saskatchewan (or was
it Alberta -- the provinces blur together) we excercised our
wits by learning to use a model with fancy pivoted grid and
a separate cooking surface, all mounted on a slice of metal
culvert.

<BR clear='all'><P> 1983 individual camera card portfolios follow, but at present
(15-10-26), these have no
pictures selected in the HTML versions. Only the WWWB PTF
browser has complete access to both selected and unselected
pictures. Usually the individual camera card portfolios will
have less up-to-date captioning than the collected year file. The
advantage of the collected file is that the picture tags are
easier to edit into a coherent account if they are copied to a
single location, with no need to string together a series of
confusing links to different camera card folders. The
disadvantage is that two or more separate slide show scripts can
exist containing the same pictures. This creates a situation
where picture descriptions and textual commentary of the same
subject can get out of coordination. Updating the one doesn't update
the other.

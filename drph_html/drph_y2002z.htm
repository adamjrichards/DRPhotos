<P> 2002e year - Complete portfolio, original, superceded.*
<P>Everybody won new slippers in Lison's Monopoly-type game of chance.
<P>Welland Canal hike
<P>
<P>Shoring put in to support the ceiling. Chris is wearing his caving head-lamp.
We located the old abandoned railway tunnel underneath an early version of
the Welland Canal. After exploring it end to end, we cooked a lunch and
continued our walk. The eastern end is blocked by a fence and deep water, so
you can't get out of the tunnel except by backtracking. The floor consists of
the remains of railway ties laid on crushed stone. Except for the ice in the
middle, the walking is fairly safe and dry -- in times of low water.
<P>The old canal is flowing directly overhead at this point.
<P>Chris' head-lamp is behind the ice.
<P>Diesel, the dog, had fun smashing the ice, jumping up and planting his
forepaws down hard.
<P>Looks better upside down?
<P>Same general area as the tunnel.
<P>Wouldn't even THINK of swimming here. The summer water line is near the top of
those pillars.
<P>We pitched a few stones ourselves.
<P>But we intepid explorers take our frugal fare wherever we can.
<P>
<P>Niag. Gorge walk from Queenston
<P>
<P>Below, another weekend hike with Audra and Merle along the
Niagara Gorge south from Queenston. You can walk as far
as the powerplant entrance. We had a picnic on the river bank.
<P>ArtPark grounds on the US side. There used to be a railway suspension bridge
crossing the Niagara River here.
<P>With a steep drop into the Niagara River.
<P>Even banal images can have their colour saturation increased by 50 percent.
<P>Dealer, collector? Somebody in Queenston village loves Land Rovers.
<P>Somewhere down the Niagara River and across the water: Toronto, lurking in the
mist.
<P>
<P>A walk along the tourist front of Niagara Falls.
<P>The gate was unlocked. Everyone else seemed to be trespassing, so down we
went. A nervous looking security guard was talking on his cell-phone. We took
some pictures and went back up.
<P>The above two form a panorama.
<P>
<P>Twenty-Mile Creek hike
<P>
<P>Lots of scope for rockscapes, and <I>rotscapes</I>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>We decide to continue on to the upper falls. The river bed here has a subtle
beauty. Reminiscent of an Oriental garden, perhaps.
<P>D'you think my picture titles are sophomoric, ... Merle?
<P>
<P>Passover trip to Montreal
<P>Roofscape, looking up-river, towards Ontario.
<P>Eastward, toward the Eastern Townships.
<P>
<P>Jo Smith and ?, over to see our Africa pictures.
<P>
<P>Rankin R. canoe trip.
<P>
<P>Meg Morden's feet on the shore, near the lodge. Pollution or natural foam?
The actual canoe trip down the Rankin R. was so hectic, I didn't have time
to take my hands off the paddle for evan a single picture.
<P>Testing out the new digital camera
<P>Patio construction
<P>Many, many wheel-barrow loads later, Merle hammers the last stone in place.
<P>And beds it down (forever?)
<P>Next morning.
<P>Interlude
<P>Inauguration
<P>Montreal
<P>and the sea is not filled.
<P>Pointe Claire to visit Fraser
<P>
<P>Woodside
<P>Port Dover, shopping for an outboard motor
<P>The marina
<P>Dimitri's birthday
<P>Port Dalhousie again
<P>Bike trip Port Colborne to Welland
<P>Homage to Piranesi series.
<P>Home again after the holidays
<P>
<P>Adventures in sailing
<P>Ottawa St. to dry out
<P>His master's vice (old victrola) in the background.
<P>How doth the little busy bee improve each shining hour.
<P>Sailing again
<P>(Dunderheads?)
<P>Chipmunk capers
<P>Hard to get down a narrow crack when your cheeks are bulging with seeds.
These were taken with an Olympus D-40 digital camera on a miniature tripod.
Activated by the camera's remote control device.
<P>Complications: The camera must be "on" all the time for the remote control to
work. This rapidly uses up the battery. I took about 30 minutes to get these
pictures. Then the camera shut itself down. An outboard 3 volt power supply
would help.
<P>The effective range of the remote control is about 5 feet. And it has to be
aimed at the front of the camera, so the lens has to be pointing towards
you. This means you have to sit close to the subject and wait very, very
quietly, and hope the battery doesn't give out.
<P>The chipmunk investigated the camera, putting its paws on the tripod.
<P>Biking for excercise (and scenery)
<P>Or, they went that-away, Sherif. This vine is actually pointing east
<P>Port Dalhousie Yacht Club moorings.
<P>Port Weller
<P>
<P>Wine tasting with Pearl and Jerome
<P>
<P>Sure, you've got a cute winery, but can you kick Butt at the international
competitions?
<P>It was supposed to be late-harvest-Vidal-flavoured ice-cream. Tasted more
like vanilla.
<P>Port Dalhousie pier group
<P>A blurred original sometimes responds better to watercolourization.
<P>Reminds me of a painting from the 1920s or 30s in the depressing realism
school. Who? Email me at ...
<P>East pier marina parking lot, toxic-looking lighting, sitting in the front
seat of the min-van.
<P>Grimsby walk
<P>We were looking for "old vines" vintages.
<P>Niagara Falls Nature Club Canoe Outing on the Niagara River.
September 15, 2002
<P>
<P>
<P>Merle and Derek decide to have a look at the N.O.T.L. waterfront.
<P>
<P>Petrolia to visit Diana and Brian
Just before their departure on the Great South-West Motor-cycle Tour.
<P>
<P>Probably not an ancient Roman harbour defence.
<P>Even the Great Wall of Petrolia is closed for the night.

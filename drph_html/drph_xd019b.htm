<P>Hike to Bertha Lake, continued.
<P>We decide to walk round the lake.
<P>More a quick splash, actually. The water was chilly.
<P>A note for Miriam: A careful reading of the text suggests that
Parks Canada has discovered a species of altruistic plant. This

<P>Our tent is almost visible above that gap in the trees in the
centre. Near the RVs.
<P>Another mood.
<P>The Crypt Lake ferry returns with a load of hikers.
<P>This cloud seems to be following us.

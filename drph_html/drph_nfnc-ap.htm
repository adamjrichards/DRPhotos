<I>D196-091 07-09-06</I> - <B>Our motel room in Whitney.</B><xxx>

<BR>A Niagara Falls Nature Club weekend outing. We decide to
head up to Algonquin Park early and get established in our Whitney motel
before the rest of the group assembles at suppertime. Arriving early
afternoon, we have time to explore.
<BR> The closest notable park location, Opeongo Lake, gives us a chance to get
re-acquainted with our inner paddlers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-096.jpeg">
<I>D196-096 07-09-07</I> - <B>Canoes everywhere.</B><xxx>

<BR>The dockside area really is canoe city, THE location for outfitting with
everything you might need for canoe-tripping.
<BR>

<I>D196-107 07-09-07</I> - <B>Canoe transporter.</B><xxx>

<BR>Even at this September date, groups are leaving for a sojourn in the
interior. One group we watched, was planning to camp on a remote island at
the head of the lake and paddle around the vicinity for the week-end.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-111.jpeg">
<I>D196-111 07-09-07</I> - <B>A few happy wanderers set off...</B><xxx>

<BR>A water-taxi capable of carrying canoes on an overhead rack transports them
to their get-away retreat.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-112.jpeg">
<I>D196-112 07-09-07</I> - <B>To be deposited way down the lake...</B><xxx>

<BR>This located at some remote campsite, miles down the lake. So they'll be
able to spend more time in and around camp without taking half a day to get
there, and another half-day to get back.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-119.jpeg">
<I>D196-119 07-09-07</I> - <B>We take the path to Booth's Rock ...</B><xxx>

<BR>The access road to Rock Lake is not far from the access road to Lake Opeongo.
The park brochures promise us a hiking trail to Booth Rock. Parking next to a
possible swimming beach, we set off into the woods.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-120.jpeg">
<I>D196-120 07-09-07</I> - <B>The path gets steeper and steeper.</B><xxx>

<BR>We pass through an area with fantastically contorted tree roots.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-129.jpeg">
<I>D196-129 07-09-07</I> - <B>Reminds me, Merle, how about a hug?</B><xxx>

<BR>These remind me of walks in the mountains of New England. I have several
pictures of trees appearing to clutch boulders with their roots.
<BR>

<I>0212-03 83-06-04</I> - <B>1983 - Trees on trees, Vancouver.</B><xxx>

<BR>This appears to be a familiar pattern in areas where tree seedlings germinate
in forest litter which is subsequently removed due to erosion, fire or
logging activity.

<BR>We eventually reach the outlook over Booth Lake.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-135.jpeg">
<I>D196-135 07-09-07</I> - <B>Better check the guidebook.</B><xxx>

<BR>The Algonquin guidebooks actually give you location-specific information. You
can stand on the clifftop and read notes on what you can see in front of you.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-137.jpeg">
<I>D196-137 07-09-07</I> - <B>Rock Lake from Booth's Rock.</B><xxx>

<BR>And another impressive thing about the park. Someone who likes to hang out in
the White Mountains of New Hampshire, gets used to the idea that a scenic
view has to have a certain altitude.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-138.jpeg">
<I>D196-138 07-09-07</I> - <B>A hazy day.</B><xxx>

<BR>The viewpoints in Algonquin Park are never more than a few hundred feet above
the surrounding terrain. But the intimate quality of the experience can be
equal to more distant views from higher mountains. You can actually see the
closer details.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-143.jpeg">
<I>D196-143 07-09-07</I> - <B>The guidebook says ...</B><xxx>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-144.jpeg">
<I>D196-144 07-09-07</I> - <B>#7: "We are in the picture." OK?</B><xxx>

<BR>Presumeably a reference to the effects of human activity, such as railroads,
lumbering, outdoor recreation, etc.
<BR>

<I>D196-145 07-09-07</I> - <B>Looking north-west.</B><xxx>

<BR>It's an agreeable experience to have a guidebook that not only clues you in
on general background but complements the scene in front of you.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-146.jpeg">
<I>D196-146 07-09-07</I> - <B>South-west.</B><xxx>

<BR>Something like having surtitles at the opera or captions underneath National
Geographic pictures.

<I>D196-153 07-09-07</I> - <B>Leading to an even higher viewpoint?</B><xxx>

<BR>Just when we think we've reached the summit, an even higher viewpoint
emerges.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-155.jpeg">
<I>D196-155 07-09-07</I> - <B>The treetops swirl in the breeze.</B><xxx>

<BR>The air seems calm at the summit, but a steady breeze down the lake puts the
treetops in constant motion.

<I>D196-156 07-09-07</I> - <B>Rock Lake retrospective.</B><xxx>

<BR>A look back the way we've come.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-157.jpeg">
<I>D196-157 07-09-07</I> - <B>We head down via a loop trail.</B><xxx>

<I>D196-166 07-09-07</I> - <B>On Judge Barclay's old estate. </B><xxx>

<BR>The trail leads back down from Booth Rock to the site of an old holiday
cottage from the early days of this area.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-168.jpeg">
<I>D196-168 07-09-07</I> - <B>Searching for the mansion ruins.</B><xxx>

<BR>Isolated locations like this were once reached by a rail line that used to
pass beneath Booth Rock along the side of Rock Lake. At first we can't find
the site. Not much remains of the old buildings, except low concrete
foundations, half-covered with pine needles.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-173.jpeg">
<I>D196-173 07-09-07</I> - <B>The front steps?</B><xxx>

<BR>How did this tree, which is probably older than the ruins get planted right
in front of these steps? They must have led straight into the house. So it's
a puzzle how a tree, that looks older that the ruin, could have been located
exactly in the path of the people who would use that step.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-174.jpeg">
<I>D196-174 07-09-07</I> - <B>An old tree here doesn't make sense.</B><xxx>

<BR>Perhaps the tree is really much younger than it looks. Or perhaps Judge
Barclay was an eccentric who was making a point about trees taking precedence
over development. Not bloody likely, you say?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-175.jpeg">
<I>D196-175 07-09-07</I> - <B>The privy?</B><xxx>

<BR>We speculate on how things originally looked. What kind of lifestyle the
cottagers enjoyed. The privy is easiest to identify.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-176.jpeg">

<BR>The docks could have accomodated at least three boats or canoes.

<BR>We follow the loop trail back to the right-of-way of Booth's logging
railroad.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-192.jpeg">
<I>D196-192 </I> - <B>old right-of-way, Booth's logging RR.</B><xxx>

<BR>The tracks are gone but this line once carried some of the heaviest
east-west traffic in the Dominion of Canada. After the logging trade
declined the line fell into disuse.

<BR>Back in the town of Whitney, the Nature Club group assembles for dinner. This
is at a very handy gas station and restaurant across the road from the motel.

<I>D196-208 07-09-07</I> - <B>Back 40 culture: maple syrup, snowshoes.</B><xxx>

<BR>Derek is in his element, judging from the self-satisfied look.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-209.jpeg">
<I>D196-209 07-09-08</I> - <B>Pie for breakfast.</B><xxx>

<BR>That's the mayor of the region, on the left, and our waitress behind him. She
normally works the gas pump out front, but "today, what with so many of you
guys hanging out here, we're real busy."
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-210.jpeg">
<I>D196-210 07-09-08</I> - <B>Normally, I prefer oatmeal.</B><xxx>

<BR>We enjoy all the joys of hearty, guilt-free, country-style food.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D196/D196-212.jpeg">
<I>D196-212 07-09-08</I> - <B>Looks like Merle's polished off her pie.</B><xxx>

<BR>Why is it, that so many of our Nature Club pictures seem to be focussed
on eating? Well, for one thing, we're all gathered in one place, in one
compact group. For another, we don't have binoculars in front of our
faces, spoiling any attempt at candid portraiture.
<BR><B><P>SEPT 8, DAY 3, Saturday.</B>

<I>D196-232 07-09-08</I> - <B>The group sights a new plant.</B><xxx>

<BR>While the group is attuned to the faintest twitter, and notices the tiniest
nuances of plumage in birds too distant to be seen with a wide-angle lens,
Derek's mind wanders off to collect ambiance: vistas, shapes, textures,
colours.

<BR>But most of the time he longs for an inspiring view, ideally with clouds
overhead, a distant horizon, and perhaps a river running through it. All the
other camera buffs in the group seem to dote on long telephoto lenses. But he
constantly struggles to get it all in. To step back. To relate foreground
object to background context. I guess he's just a wide-angle, zoom out kind
of guy. A lumper rather than a splitter.

<I>D196-253 07-09-08</I> - <B>Recent beaver engineering projects.</B><xxx>

<BR>Beavers are fascinating because they're one of the few animals that have an
advanced programme to restructure their environment. Most creatures only
change their environment by the side effects they have on it.

<BR>Why do art photographers take this kind of picture? Maybe because of the
abstract patterns, textures or colours. Derek rarely admits to a fondness
for this sort of thing because it might lead to that bottomless pit named
"self expression".

<BR>The Lookout Trail sounds promising. From the parking lot, the path leads

not to recall my family's little joke: Fraser, stop the car and get that one
for the garden.

<BR>
<BR>  This is a throwback to our days living in Quebec. We Richardses, being
renters all our lives, were often a bit amused and bemused by the Cliff's
gardening preoccupations. Our own gardens were always the strictly vegetarian
allotments of apartment dwellers who fail to see the point of beautifying
someone else's property. This is taken in the Cliff's garden behind the small
apartment building on Westmore Ave in Montreal where they lived in the late
40s before moving to Pointe Claire.

the limit of vision. This is decorated with a few small lakes and the rocks
we stand on. The utter neatness of it leaves you feeling pleasantly stunned
by the groomed appearance of all those tree-tops.

<BR><P><B>Notes:</B>
<BR> 11-02-22: Have been trying to add a few lengthier sound clips. On the
theory that a more general set of remarks doesn't have to be tied to
individual pictures. And would be easier to write. Can usually think of
something to say about the context of a group of pictures, even if the
individual pictures seem to invite only perfunctory remarks. Alas, This is
more difficult than anticipated in practice. Picture specific comments get
out of step with the relevant picture when the narrative simply plays behind
a timed presentation of the pictures. Needs a lot of tweaking of text and
pictures to keep things coordinated. Why not just create sound clips as in
the past for each individual piture?
<BR>
<BR>Could try for text that is less specific. Musical background works this way,
but what kind of text wouldn't sound vapid?
<BR>
<BR>The SPEAK.SCR and REC.SCR commands give interesting options for recording
sound clips. See above.
<BR>
<BR>Another way to approach this might be to treat lengthier sound clips as
browse-able material. Set up an option to play the clip when in browse mode.
<BR>
<BR>11-05-22: Not satisfied with the longer narration clips, plus manual
navigation ad lib. Better than no sound, but difficult to view the pictures
in any kind of logical synch with the narration. Split up the text to voice
clip comments associated with individual pics. Now try voice recording.

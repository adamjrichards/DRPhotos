<P>    It was at the conclusion of a lecture to the regiment's
junior officers. The war had been over for more than a year. But
without the prospect of battles to be fought, Major Snell was
finding it hard to impart a sense of urgency. In fact, he was
having considerable difficulty maintaining his own sense of
vocation. Other matters had a way of intruding.
<P>    "So, then, I am reliably informed by Higher Authority that
winter has officially ended. As you are no doubt aware, the ice
in the St. Lawrence has recently been abolished by
order-in-council ..." He said this with a perfectly straight
face, and it was received by an audience of equally straight
faces. "The highways of Lower Canada, such as they are, will
soon be solid enough to support marching feet and heavy
equipment. Plans have been completed for field exercises with
the Artillery and it is up to you to ensure that every
preparation for the campaigning season is well in hand. See to
your regimental responsibilities, each of you. That is all.
Ensign Fielding, remain. You are required on a staff matter.
Good day, gentlemen." 
<P>    When the rest had gone, Major Snell, with Ensign Fielding in
tow, retired to his private offices where Midshipman Harris was
already waiting. The Major sat down, motioned his guests to
seats, placed fingertips together in an arch, and then stared
out the window.
<P>    Two promising young officers, eager for adventure, facing
the cynical old soldier. Should he warn them off heroics, steer
them toward the safe berth? Or tell them exactly what they
wanted to hear?
<P>    Like a patient schoolmaster he began by tediously reviewing
the obvious. At the same time, he felt a sort of tolerant
amusement at the predictable futility, the repetitious
circularity of all human striving. 
<P>     "Fielding, you doubtless recall the circumstances of your
own arrival in Montreal. The documents you were devious enough
to unearth in Sackets Harbor have been diligently examined. The
information they contained, regarding an American expedition to
the Northwest, has, it appears, been corroborated by an
additional source."
<P>    He noticed that James' interest in military life had
suddenly reawakened. The Major's own knowledge of military and
administrative life was far too deep to permit him to display
any such candour. The only emotion he permitted himself was
amused cynicism.
<P>    "Admiral Fisher informs me -- allow me to read from his own
hand:
<P>          
<P>              I have had the pleasure of a revealing conversation with
          a Lt. Martindale travelling like myself on half-pay through
          the northern territories of the United States. By rare good
          fortune, this gentleman chanced last autumn to interview a
          citizen of Buffalo who told him that a body of irregular
          cavalry and some naval personnel would be collected this
          winter for the purpose of forming an expedition to go by
          ship from Lake Erie to the head of the Lake Superior.
<P>              It seems they have also procured a second vessel, now on
          Lake Superior above the Falls of St. Mary. It is my
          assessment that whoever controls this enterprise (and I
          suspect it is Colonel Enright) will possess the ability to
          move men and equipment to the limit of navigation at any time
          following the spring breakup.
<P>          
<P>    Major Snell flung the papers down, folded his hands and
looked directly at Harris and Fielding. Sheep to the shearing,
moths to the flame. All too willingly the heroes gird their
loins for someone else's triumph. But perhaps it wouldn't be a
total defeat. Merely a salutary lesson in the parameters of
military life.
<P>    "Despite the Admiral's keen enthusiasm, the Governor is
still of a mind to believe the matter is blown out of
proportion. He 'refuses to allow himself to become agitated by
mere rumours of plots based on the conniving activities of
promotion-deprived Yankee colonels and their Irish rebel
friends, whiskey-peddling fur traders, or that meddlesome Lord
Selkirk.' That was an accurate paraphrase of his words.
<P>    "In any case, the area is quite beyond his practical
jurisdiction. I too have the greatest difficulty contemplating
the maintenance of a conventional field detachment at such great
distance inland. Simply getting them out to the Red River
defeats the imagination, let alone the commissariat department."
<P>    The Major noted that Fielding's eyes were starting to glaze
over again. He glanced at his watch. He'd best herd the sheep
out of here, and soon. Another important visitor was due. But
before that visitor arrived, a still-unannounced decision had to
be finalised.
<P>    "So, I fear, it will be regimental duties as usual. At least
as far as the Montreal garrison is concerned."  He paused and
cleared his throat. Both Fielding and Harris made a convulsive,
awakening movement, rising to go about to their normal routine.
They'd obviously written the project off as a predictable
example of the inability of those in authority to think ahead.
<P>    "I have not yet finished, gentlemen, please do sit down
again. Although there's to be no offical response, 'other means'
have been proposed to remedy our regrettable deficiency of
influence in the Northwest. Over the winter, we've had fresh
reports of atrocities on the Red River. The Governor is beset on
all sides by Lord Selkirk, the Montreal fur traders, Admiral
Fisher, and soon, no doubt, deputations of anxious citizens. He
must seem to act while quietly doing nothing, if you follow me."
<P>    And I also must act, Major Snell thought, without destroying
these two amiable young fools ... and without ruining myself.
<P>    "Now then, as you are aware, the Society for the
Diffusion of Geographical Knowledge has proposed the
dispatch of an expedition to the Northwest. For the ostensive
purpose of scouting out the lie of the land and collecting
scientific information. To this end, a detachment of disbanded
cavalry will be engaged at private expense. The group will be
provided with military leadership and sent out upon what will
euphemistically be described as a 'survey mission'. That they
will be armed against the perils of the march goes without
saying.
<P>    "As far as the newspapers are concerned, they are to proceed
quietly in the direction of our outpost at Drummond Island, but
will actually continue on past the Falls of St. Mary to Fort
William. There they will trans-ship, or should I say,
trans-canoe, and head inland. At a higher level, it will be an
open secret that their role is to investigate the geography of
the Red River district, while at the same time exerting a
'quieting influence' on all unruly elements, whether settler,
half-breed, or Yankee colonel. This concession, it is hoped,
will induce Lord Selkirk to desist from sending out his own
troop of mercenaries." The Major smiled, finger tips together
again in an arch.
<P>    "Excuse me, sir, but is there a chance ...?"
<P>    " ... of volunteering, Fielding? Not in the least." He
continued to smile faintly. The Major was taking a kind of
connoisseur's pleasure in watching the pawns try to control
their own positioning.
<P>    "A few surplus officers of the garrison, a number of men
from the Indian Department, as well as a troop of superannuated
dragoons will be detached and assigned to the expedition. No,
you cannot volunteer. It is too late. I have already complied
with a request for the services of two junior officers -- quite
useless fellows."
<P>    He grinned wickedly at the disappointed faces before him.
<P>    "Their names are Harris and Fielding." Both leapt to
attention in front of Major Snell's desk. "... And I, oddly
enough, may be going along, at least as far as Drummond Island.
Solely to keep an eye on you two. By the way, you are to report
to Admiral Fisher for further instruction. At the moment, that
gentleman appears to be the chief proponent of Geographical
Science in British North America." 
<P>    Ensign Fielding and Midshipman Harris rose again to leave.
Each bowed deeply, out of renewed respect for the workings of
authority. The System had at last done something they very much
wanted it to do. (Major Snell remembered how another young and
very flustered Ensign had once actually kissed his hand at the
culmination of a particularly trying interview. On that
occasion, the spectre of disgrace and ridicule had been
summarily banished at the Adjutant's benevolent whim.)
<P>    A half grin twisted one corner of Snell's mouth. He
dismissed them with a cheerful "be gone" flick of his wrist. As
the door was closing, he called out:
<P>    "Oh, yes, Fielding. ... Do drop your mother and father a
line before you depart into oblivion. Parents really do worry
about these things, you know."
<P>    Major Snell had only a few moments left to make up his own
mind on a matter of importance. His next visitor was due very
soon. Young Fielding, at least, was safely out of the way. A
long-standing debt to the Captain had been paid off at last. Old
Fieldpiece would think the assignment a plum. Especially since
he'd apparently been the first one to urge the project that evening at
the Governor's <I>levee</I>. Now, there remained the matter of a few
pressing obligations of a pecuniary nature. Perhaps the wolf, no
less than the sheep, might be painlessly relieved of a little
wool.
<P>    A knock came at the door. The head of Major Snell's aide
peeped round. "A Mr. Maidstone to see you, sir."
<P>    "Ah yes, the Yankee 'optical merchant'; I've been expecting
him. Please show the gentleman in ... and bring us some
whiskey."
<P>
<P>                                          ***
<P>
<P>    Admiral Fisher was busy conducting interviews in his rented
lodgings when Harris and Fielding arrived. His secretary
installed them in a drawing room stacked round the walls with
bundles of government reports tied up in red ribbon. Spread out
on tables lay maps weighted down by mysterious samples of wood.
Some were tagged with the names of locations up the Ottawa
River. A South Sea Island war club hung on one wall. A
wicked-looking weapon tricked out in shark's teeth along both
edges. The Admiral knew the value of unusual trinkets for
keeping his guests off-balance.
<P>    "You admire that, do you?" said he, ushering earlier
visitors out the door. "Use it to terrify me feminine admirers.
Never fails to stimulate the vital juices ... ahem. You've heard
the news? Good, even the Governor has been persuaded to lend his
patronage to the project. Probably because it won't cost him a
shilling. You'll volunteer, of course?  Splendid." The Admiral
hadn't doubted it a moment.
<P>    He dashed from the room and returned breathless, waving a
document. "Never have I seen sailing orders so convoluted. ...
Hmmm, let me see. Here are a few of the major points you should
be aware of." He scanned down the paper, looking for lively
passages that would rally his young recruits to the cause.
<P>          
<P>              ... You are to proceed to the Red River country in
          company with the earliest spring canoe brigade; there to
          reside a suitable interval, engaging in such activities as
          will acquaint all local interests with your presence and
          capabilities; to collect those botanical, animal or mineral
          specimens of interest to natural philosophy; to note the
          condition of the soil and climate for agricultural purposes;
          to examine outstanding natural features with a view to
          determining their effect on military operations and
          communications; to observe the customs, distribution and
          predisposition of the indigenes to the British cause; to
          search for large fossilized bones ...
<P>          
<P>    Not as lively-sounding as he'd hoped. The Admiral permitted
himself a brief, wistful smile. "So far as the 49th parallel is
concerned, I have been compelled to hold the more forward part
of our plans in abeyance -- the better to secure official
sanction. You will hear more of that matter in due course."
<P>    "One titbit, however." Glancing portentiously at the faces
of his visitors, he read a final provision.
<P>          
<P>              ... You the bearer of this commission, are empowered to
          take whatever steps you judge necessary to <I>forestall and
          nullify</I> the researches of any foreign interests who might be
          expected to retail abroad a premature, erroneous or hostile
          account of the uses of the region. ...
<P>          
<P>    He paused and looked out the window while removing his
reading spectacles. "Odd phraseology, that. But it was the best
we could do with the mandate given. What d'you think of the
project?"
<P>    James spoke first. "May I ask who has been appointed leader,
sir?"
<P>    "Not finally decided. ... Unfortunately, that worrysome
matter is still in the hands of the Governor.  I expect you will
eventually face considerable challenge to your own leadership
ability. Er, not to mention, your sense of tact. ... But, into
the breach, so to speak. We <I>do</I> have the accumulation of stores
and the selection of all other staff well in hand."
<P>     In actual fact, the Admiral knew the administration was
doing everything possible in the way of foot-dragging. In
addition, certain individuals were promoting the project's ruin
at high levels. But, in the interests of keeping up morale,
better to press on in triumphant assurance of ultimate
victory.
<P>    "I suggest you begin your own preparations immediately. And
remember this: you will be to all outward appearances civilians.
So leave the flashy uniforms behind and be prepared to remain in
the field for up to two years. Did you hear that correctly? I
said two <I>years</I>. A sobering thought. A one-way journey to the
mouth of the Columbia may take six to eight months from Montreal
by canoe. In addition, you will be facing the rigours of overland
travel. Penetrating the sacred homelands of potentally hostile
aborigines."
<P>    "I'm ready, sir," replied James, "and I'm sure Harris
concurs. Harris?" For once, Harris seemed nonplussed.
<P>    "This will be no picnic, gentlemen. You will be travelling
without the advantages of a large expeditionary force. In other
words, no big guns, no big battalions, no fleet to back you up.
So have a care for your personal safety. Do you take my meaning?
See that you are both adequately provided."
<P>    "Mmm, yes, sir, something more serviceable than a dress
sword," mumbled Harris. "Two <I>years</I>, you said. Sir?"
<P>    The ashen face of his young protege, showed an abundant
awareness of the challenges that lay ahead. The Admiral was
nevertheless confident that here were two inovative minds, able
to cope with any difficulty. In addition, Fielding gave every
sign of contributing those qualities of robust, outdoor
self-reliance that Harris might lack. Between the two of them,
the interests of The Society for the Diffusion of Geographical
Knowledge would be well served.  Strangely enough, the current
difficulty over the expedition's leadership might actually
provide certain opportunities for creative improvisation.
<P>    "Come, cheer up, my lads. Share a tot with an old sailor."
The Admiral fetched a decanter from the sideboard, poured out
three thimblefuls of rum, and began to declaim in what he hoped
was his best ward-room style.
<P>    "Although this expedition is essentially scientific, I
should like you to know, in strictest confidence, that it is
also intended by the Society, to demonstrate to whomsoever may
dog our footsteps, that we British will not stand idly by, while
our geographical interests are trifled with, and furthermore,
you should also be aware that you stand today, in the gallant
company of all those heroes who have sacrificed so much for so
many, all the while staunchly supported by those who stood
behind them, ... er, while they did not stand idly by." He
paused, conquering a brief moment of lexical disorientation.
<P>    "Ahem. Your efforts will not go unnoticed. I am permitted to
say, that this project has been sanctioned at the <I>highest</I>
level. And now, you must steer your way to glory, and I must
dicker with the Governor. Down the hatch."
<P>
<P>                                          ***
<P>
<P>    It was a warm morning in early May on the Lachine
waterfront. James leaned on a piling savouring that
"out-with-the-old, in-with-the-new" feeling he'd been getting
more and more often the last few days. Colonel Enright seemed
far off. The original reason for an expedition to the Northwest
was almost forgotten. But the logistical details of the journey
were still thoroughly absorbing.
<P>    From the Ottawa to Georgian Bay, the chain of lakes and
rivers would be free of ice at last. The first Northwest canoe
brigade of the season was now making final preparations. James
and Harris loitered on the dockside, their own bags loaded. Fur
traders and porters ran in all directions, swearing after
misplaced loads and missing crew members.
<P>    "Feel a proper ruffian, gotten up like this." Harris glanced
uneasily about. "I sincerely hope none of the fellows from your
regiment are here to see us off." 
<P>    James was more used to the practical garb worn in the
Canadian backwoods. "Never mind, Harris. Look on it as
protective colouration. So you don't serve as a target to any
Yankee sharpshooters we meet along the way."
<P>    He strolled back and forth in his new cavalry boots, the
highest and blackest he'd been able to find, watching critically
as a succession of loads constituting the expedition's stores
was handed down into canoes alongside the pier. 
<P>    "Nah then, wot 'ave we 'ere?" bellowed Sergeant-Major
Crocker, the expedition's senior non-commissioned officer. He
strode to the front of a line of sweating porters and read the
stencilled label on the first parcel. "Right, another ninety
pounds of black powder an' shot packed in tins. Next man." He
ticked the sheet he was carrying as the second porter stepped
forward. "H'optical wotsit. Right, chuck it down there in the
middle someplace."
<P>    "Stop!" shrieked James, "those are fragile instruments." 
<P>    "Ooh, right you are, sir. We'll keep 'em safe, never you
fear."
<P>    James returned to Harris's side. "A good man, Sergeant
Crocker. Just the sort to have on hand in a ticklish situation.
He's our ultimate weapon. His voice alone can break glass at ten
paces. Hope that apparatus is well packed." 
<P>    "I hope <I>you</I> remember what Mr. Berg, our astronomy teacher,
taught us. Something about the moons of Jupiter, or was it
Saturn? We'll blunder all the way to the Rockies and then have
no idea how to locate our position." 
<P>    "My God, Harris, is that who I think it is?" James stood on
his toes to see across the crowded dockside. 
<P>    Harris gave a cursory glance. "Of course it is, now turn
around and put your eyes back in your head.  Or Mr. Maidstone
will think the game is up. Then we'll have to call off our little
holiday." He spoke casually, whittling a stick and doing a very
good imitation of nonchalance. "By the way, I took the liberty of
making a few more discreet inquiries. After being ejected in
Kingston, Mr. Maidstone re-entered the colony again last winter.
Came up the Lake Champlain route. Seems he's on the move again.
This time he's taken passage for the Red River colony." 
<P>    "<I>What</I>? You don't mean he'll be coming along with us?" James
had difficulty restraining himself from stealing yet another
incredulous glance. 
<P>    "Near enough. He'll be somewhere close by in the canoe
brigade. At least till we strike off on our own at the Red
River. And Mrs. Maidstone will be tagging along with him." 
<P>    "You're joking!"
<P>    James whirled round as a second figure made its way across
the quay in the wake of Maidstone. Today she was soberly
dressed, well-hatted and veiled against insects. No resemblance
to the bounteous impressions he still treasured from the
<I>soiree</I>.
<P>    "For heaven's sake, do be a bit more languid, James. Observe
the world through half-closed eyelids." 
<P>    "What are you talking about, Harris? I can't believe the
temerity of the fellow. He's already been expelled for political
agitation. Now he's going to drag that superb creature through
thousands of miles of wilderness."
<P>    "And bogs, and blackflies, and cloudbursts, and unexpected
frosts. You, the woodsman, should know and love such things.
Perhaps she does too."
<P>    "I don't think I know or love <I>you</I>, sir.
<P>    "James, my wild colonial friend, you don't know yourself.
You've lately been recruited as a -- how shall I put it -- a
'political officer'. You now possess wide discretionary powers,
as well as a meal-ticket to every mess-hall in the British
Empire. Learn to relax and exercise a little indirection." 
<P>    "Whatever do you mean?"
<P>    "The Society for the Diffusion of Geographical Knowledge --
to which you are now apprenticed for the next two years -- has
singled you out as a scholar, a gentleman, and a promising young
cad. At least, you're as close to meeting these invaluable
qualifications as we're likely to find in an army full of
bluff regimental types."
<P>    "Have a care, Harris." His face went red and fists
involuntarily clenched. 
<P>    "Oh, James, I <I>am</I> half joking. ... And half not. Do try to
be a little less virtuous and more the vigilant scoundrel. Like
any other recruit to the darker side of staff work. I tell you,
Maidstone and his pals are watching us this very moment. The man
who pitched the knife at you was persuaded to talk for a modest
premium."
<P>    "God! ... save the Prince of Wales."
<P>    "Just remember, as far as the general public is concerned, I
am a snobbish young fool with mysterious antecedents. You are a
dotty student of natural philosophy, out to practice his
fieldcraft. Feel free to improvise on these limited themes. I'm
sure you begin to get what I'm driving at." 
<P>    "... I think so."
<P>    "Ah, it's about time. Our beloved Adjutant has just arrived.
He's brought with him, if I'm not mistaken, our new commanding
officer. Shall we pay our respects?" 
<P>    They pushed through the hubbub of men loading and balancing
canoes. The crews had gathered near their assigned craft
preparatory to departure. The twenty-nine disbanded cavalrymen
and assorted sergeants and hangers-on from the Indian Department
who constituted the body of the expedition were drawn up under
the watchful eye of Sergeant-Major Crocker of Dragoons. James and
Harris made their way to the centre of the group that surrounded
their new leader. This white-haired gentleman of cherubic
countenance stood and beamed out good will while Major Snell
introduced the company.
<P>    "Captain Ames, may I present Midshipman Harris and Ensign
Fielding. They will be attached to your party for the furtherance
of all philosophical, technical and political matters. Gentlemen,
Captain Ames has just recently come up river from Quebec.
Unfortunately, his ship became unseaworthy and had to be paid off
and sold for scrap." 
<P>    "Good morning, sir, at your service," offered Harris.
<P>    "Yes indeed, ready for orders, sir," mumbled James. He was
still trying to assimilate Harris' remarks on the subject of
gentlemanly espionage. He hardly noticed as the other members of
the expedition were introduced. It seemed more prudent to
concentrate on not turning his back on Mr. Maidstone who was
lurking in the crowd nearby. 
<P>    "Let us offer thanks to Almighty God," droned Captain Ames
climbing on a packing case.  "On the eve of this momentous
enterprise, I should like to recall the words of St. Paul as he
set out on his mission to the Romans ..." The words drifted like
cobwebs on the breeze. "... And in conclusion, let us repeat the
familiar benediction of Scripture: 'May the Lord watch between
thee and me while we are absent one from the other'. Amen." 
<P>    Major Snell singled out Fielding and Harris for a final
word.
<P>    "Farewell."
<P>    "<I>Farewell</I>? ... I thought you said ... you were coming ...
with us? ... Sir?" They alternately chorused the phrases in
shocked amazement.
<P>    "Well, ... it now seems I'm compelled to return immediately
to England. Urgent family business, settle the estate and that
sort of thing. ... Look at it this way: you'll have all of the
authority of acting lieutenants for the interval. So, best of
luck, and do your utmost to keep the good ship Ames afloat --
however leaky she may be. See to it now, both of you." The Major
shook their hands with a thin smile, and melted into the crowd.
<P>    "God help us," said James. "Three thousand miles of
wilderness with only the words of St. Paul and a shipwrecked
parson to guide us." 
<P>    As the crews formed up and descended to the canoes, a cheer
rose from the crowd. A great flotilla of small craft began to
pull away from the quayside. The canoe men waved to their
families, some ecstatic with joy at departure, others sullen at
parting from loved ones for yet another year's privation on the
frontier. An increasing gulf separated those hardy adventurers
of the Northwest from the timid citizenry on shore. As they
synchronized their stroke and the huge <I>canots-de-maitre</I>
gathered way, the paddlers broke into traditional songs.
<P>          
<P>          En roulant, ma boule roulant.
          En roulant, ma boule ...
          Le fils du roi s'en va chassant ... 
<P>          
<P>    James stared in a trance. As the waterfront receded, he
noticed Major Snell in heated conversation with Mr. Maidstone
who had not yet boarded. He also caught sight of a senatorial
figure in black watching from the edge of the throng. The
Admiral's gaze looked as enigmatic as his long cloak.
Impulsively, James waved. At the same time he wondered what new
and weighty plots were hatching in the brain of a man who hung a
South Sea Island war club in his drawing room to stimulate
feminine "vital juices". The Admiral saw him, raised a hand,
then turned on his heel and vanished abruptly. 
<P>    "Fear not," said Harris. "Though we walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, we will fear no evil, because the
Admiral is with us."
<P>    James managed a bleak smile as they headed upstream. There
they would enter that portal of the Northwest where the Ottawa
emerges to add its singular purple-brown flow to the blue St.
Lawrence.

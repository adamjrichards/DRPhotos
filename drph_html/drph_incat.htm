<P><rt-clk> Notes on high-altitude hiking.</B>
You might well ask: why do people go on these trips? They cost a lot of
effort, sometimes also money. They offer very little physical comfort.
There's often the chance of bad weather with no option to retreat to a
comfortable vehicle or hotel. The element of hazard may be significant.
Medical assistance is usually far off, sometimes non-existant. So if you have
a heart attack on the summit of Kilimanjaro, helicopter rescue will be out of
the question due to altitude alone, not to mention lack of cell-phone
coverage. Then there's the fitness issue. You can't, or shouldn't, tackle a
multi-day trek, without a lot of preparation, which can be time-consuming and
boring. You don't have to bicycle laps up the hydro hill every day for a
month in order to get ready for a Caribean cruise. And I won't even bother to
go into the matter of specialized equipment, such as hiking boots, tents,
etc., that may be useless for any other activity.

So WHY then? ... I have to admit, the difficulties do loom larger the older
we get. But we learn to cut corners to keep going as long as possible. For
instance, kayak trips with no portages. Treking with the added expense of
porters to carry the heavier luggage. Any scheme to experience again those
rare magic moments that you just can't get without total immersion in the
natural environment.  But this is not to claim that you can't get your quota of
magic moments some other way, only that there IS a special rapport that
outdoor trippers often experience.

I recall a day on Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. This is a 6000ft peak with
some long ascents of perhaps 4500ft from the trailheads in the surrounding
valleys. Starting at 7am we reached the summit, which was clothed in a
freezing cloud, and at about 1pm started down the opposite side. A few
hundred feet down the trail the cloud disappeared, the sun came out and the
air warmed up. This location overlooks the famous Crawford path, which in the
White Mountains of New Hampshire traverses bare ridges of rock for miles and
miles above the tree-line. The view is a perfect metaphor for the human
condition, and a very attractive metaphor, when the sun is shining. Along
this metaphor hundreds of hikers were making their way up and down the trail.
That trail being narrow, essentially single track, we had to step round a
constant stream of people still toiling their way upward. This was at an
altitude of more than 5000ft, no mean eminence in New England. Those still
ascending had come a long way up.

We hadn't expected to see so many people, but the really odd thing was that
practically all of them greeted us like long-lost friends. "How've you been.
Where are you from? Lovely weather. Doesn't it make you glad to be alive?"
They weren't smoking dope or tippling from whiskey-filled canteens, these
people were ecstatic about the stunning views, the trail that went on to the
limit of visibility, the endless ridges of blue mountains in the distance,
one behind the other, the beaming sunshine, their ability to put out
extraordinary effort and still feel happy and fit while doing so, all the
while sensing the comradship of companions on the route, united in a
common project. I'm told that similar ecstatic behaviour can be observed at
rock concerts and hockey games. 

There are also some essentially perceptual joys to be had while treking at
higher altitudes. Vision. You can see long distances. This sounds obvious
and simplistic. But in our ordinary experience we seldom see very far,
vision is interrupted in every direction by the interior walls of houses,
workplaces, vehicles, and outoors by the streetscape. Even in a "natural"
environment, surrounding trees and hedges preclude the long view. To be able
to see significant details at a very long distance can be almost like a
spiritual revelation. Westerners complain that they miss it. Easterners
don't quite know what they're talking about.

Its not enough to just look at the view. You can drive a car to the summit of
Mt Washington. Sure the outlook is impressive that way. But you can't see it
as part of your own personal itinerary in life if you only view it
vicariously and don't take the opportunity to wander in its vastness.

But there's also something special about experiencing up close the very bulk
and mass of rocks, cliffs and peaks, forests seen as whole communities of
trees, clouds that actually brush past on your own level. Ordinarily we see
most things in close detail, as items, as figures, against a negligible
ground. Way up there, you have moments of seeing the world, not only in terms
of a collection of individual details, but as the very background of your
existence. Here we can sometimes approach, if our blood sugar levels are
calibrated correctly, an almost religious experience. You begin to glimpse
the vast body of a mountain as underlying, sustaining, as providential of new
and challenging experiences. Almost ... as a deity. You could be immortal for
a few precious hours.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Piscacucho</B>

 We begin at Piscacucho, on the Machu Picchu Railroad. Kilometer 82. Our mini
bus, which has driven us this morning from our hotel in Cuzco, drops us near
the railroad station. We assemble in a staging area with a wonderful view.
The Urubamba River is below. The Inca Trail is on the opposite side.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The porters sort out their packs.</B>

The blue bags contain all our tents, sleeping bags, mats, food, fuel,
eating utensils and everything the porters individually might need. We carry
our own personal gear, such as cameras, water, extra clothing and documents.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Weighing the loads.</B>

The loads are checked at the weighing station on the right. This ensures
that no one is carrying more or less than their fair share. The porter in the
red shirt on the far side is actually hefting a propane tank.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-165</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-165.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The group. Ineke, 3rd from right.</B>

Here's the group ready to set out. Left to right: Tim, Merle, Ian, Franca,
Ineke our travel agent, Carole, Derek. Full of excitement and bubbles. Here
we're standing beside the Machu Picchu Railroad track, with the river in
back.
You can see by that lighter line along the bank that the level is low. But
the flow is still impressive.  The Urubamba is a tributary of the Amazon.
Here, we're on the Atlantic, not the Pacific watershed.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole D: Bridge across the Urubamba</B>

This is a wire-rope suspension bridge that we're about to cross. The hiking
group is on the right. The green gate on the left is where we undergo another
security check to make sure our papers are in order and all our fees paid.
It's not a bridge over troubled waters. The Urubamba seemed very happy that
day. At least to a group of hikers champing at the bit to get started.
Taken from the middle of the bridge looking down into the Urubamba River. The
mountains on the horizon lead us forward into the interior where we'll spend
the next four days walking.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Bromeliads will be our companions.</B>

We see some of the plant life that will be common along the trail. The dry
brown grass indicates the end of the growing season in these parts. Mid June
is midwinter.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-172</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-172.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Farm terraces along Machu Picchu RR.</B>

Now we're fairly begun. Those terraces opposite might be of Inca origin. But
the farmers of today are more inclined to the type of tillage you see in the
field beside the river. This well-groomed plot awaits the coming planting
season. you can see signs of farm roads and paths on the hillside. Reminds me
of how much you can discover in a photo that you didn't see at the time.
The mountains become our companions. Giant rocks beside the trail gives us
the feeling of being planted on the bosom of Mother Earth.
And impressive bosoms they are too, judging from those crags on the other
side of the river. We're into some serious mountain country now. Agriculture
is confined between high valley walls.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Our guide, Angelo.</B>

Angelo, our guide, introduces himself. Here he's expounding on safety
procedures, not getting lost, and the general context of our excursion. We
thought him a bit glib at first, but we soon come to like him a great deal.
His english is quite fluent.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-176</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-176.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Residences along the trail.</B>

The trail at this point isn't exactly wilderness. We find several lodges like
this soliciting tourists along the way. It's uncertain how you would contact
the proprietors to make a reservation, but a place like this would do nicely
for a few lazy days of downtime or recuperation.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

The clouds are cooperating with the photographers in the group. The plants
along the way a beginning to look more and more desert-like.
Here's a kind of plant that Derek sympathises with. He doesn't think that the
tree is bearded because it's an old codger of a tree. This is probably some kind
of moss that flourishes in wetter weather and dries up in the off season.
We're truly launched. The trail is a beaten dirt path, typical of this
section, clearly marked, no ambiguity at all. We see those snow clad peaks
and wonder if we'll ever again be able to climb that high.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Former cochineal bug.</B>

Angelo stops at a large cactus plant, picks off a bit of white fluff. He
mashes it against his palm producing this brilliant red smear. It's the
cochineal bug that used to be harvested for dye. Still has limited use in the
cosmetics industry.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Cochinal bugs on cactus.</B>

The bug grows on a kind of prickly pear cactus. It feed on the cactus but
doesn't seem to harm it. I don't think I'd like to collect cochineal for a
living, what with those fearsome spines to stick into your fingers.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-182</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-182.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Inca trail refreshment stand.</B>

Small villages line the trail. Local women sell drinks and snacks to the
hikers. They carry their wares to the booths on their backs. Angelo buys us
prickly-pear cactus fruit. Delicious. You can sometimes buy it at home in the
supermarket. Mind you don't pick up nearly invisible spines from the skin.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-183</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-183.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole and Tim.</B>

Derek takes his own picture in Carole's sunglasses. Ton-ton Macoute style,
like Papadoc Duvalier's henchpeople in Haiti used to wear. They reflect back
the bemused stare of the uneasy onlooker, revealing nothing of the wearer's
intentions.
Well, Derek wasn't really feeling obstinate, like a donkey. Just, feeling
a little quiet noticing the fatigue of the trail on the first day out.
Well, perhaps Derek isn't quite so prickly. But oddly enough, for his
retirement party, many years ago, he got a cactus that was just as well-armed
as this tree. If this was a hint, he's taken a long time to get the point.
Ok. That was a weak attempt at trailside humour. But one or two people
sometimes laugh. There's nothing like a hike or a camping trip to help you
get to know people. I advise it for all those contemplating marriage.
Another typical trail view, rising higher. An Agave plant. Sends up a tall
fruiting stalk and then the plant dies or goes into dormancy. The seeds,
presumeably, get spread by birds and animals looking for a snack.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The Inca trail is also ...</B>

The Inca Trail isn't only for hikers. It's a highway for villagers going
about their business. Although not suitable for wheeled vehicles, it carries
a steady stream of local people and pack animals bearing loads of produce
and supplies.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-190</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-190.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>A commercial corridor.</B>

This pack train is followed by a young lad on a pony somewhere round
the corner up ahead. The animals seem to know exactly where they're
going. Don't deviate right or left and pay no attention to the hikers.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-193</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-193.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>The trail rises.</B>

Gaining altitude now. The landscape spreads out as we rise. Less habitation.
That cut on the far side of the valley may be the Machu Picchu Railroad. An
Inca ruin lies beside the tracks on the left side of the river. We're
beginning to be intoxicated by the open air and the heights surrounding us.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-199</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-199.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Still a few hamlets.</B>

A rest stop with the villagers selling snacks. Ineke has a one-sided
conversation with that little kid on the right. He accepted a banana for a
snack.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-200</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-200.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Hiker rest stop.</B>

A guide or hiker from another group. This seems to be a regular stopping
place for most tourists coming through.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-202</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-202.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

Two of the ladies who maintain this rest stop. The one on the right has the
typical garb of Quechua mountain women, the fedora hat and petticoats. The
woman on the left, who was in charge of the refreshment stand, dresses like
us. Except for the lack of hiking boots.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-203</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-203.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Portal. What's inside?</B>

A picturesque doorway for Derek's portal collection. I wonder what's behind
it. Gardening tools, grain storage, or do people liv<e> in there?

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>d230-087</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/d230/d230-087.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole D: Other facilities.</B>

Aha! We can guess what's inside that door. We don't go in to check, but we
suspect that the owner is probably trying to salt away the greenbacks for her
retirement fund. Or maybe a holiday in Regional Niagara.
<BR clear='all'><P><B>June 18 Lunch stop.</B>

At last, a lunch stop at a regular campsite. One of the group is already
nibbling on the grass. Looks like the site has hydro, no mean achievement
this high up in the mountains.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Campground.</B>

Our blue dining tent, with members of the group on the right. The stream may
be fed from Inca channels in the upper mountains collecting rain and
meltwater. Far right, guides are doing dishes, thankfully, upstream from the
donkey.
Waiting for lunch. Those are the blue-wrapped packs of our porters in the
foreground. We loll around, take pictures and chat, enjoying the sunshine of a
perfect day.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Gotcha. Porter load, right.</B>

Carole ambushes me with a snap. Our porters carry their loads in these blue
bags with a blanket wrapped round shoulders and forehead while they cling to
the straps. They don't have the full backpacks used by more affluent
outfitters, such as The Gap.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

We seem to be leaving the last villages behind. You can see a hydro tower in
the valley. Perhaps an Inca ruin at centre. The trail is so well used that
you're seldom out of sight of other hikers. 500 per day, we heard. Even so,
not so congested that we bump into each other.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-222</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-222.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Still a few farms.</B>

Some agriculture even at this height. The cows look healthy though nibbling
on last year's grass. The hills appear to have contour lines. Probably animal
tracks. Centuries of foraging have produced a kind of miniature terracing
effect.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B></B>

We're moving briskly along now, but still outpaced by the porters. The
surrounding mountains are visible in full magnificence. A typical trail
section here of beaten gravel. Few stairs, no clambering, but a steady
ascent.

<I>V11-10-10</I> - <B>On the trail FX</B>

Here's my first example of what I call the photo-sketch technique. It's done
in the studio after the foot slogging is over with. Not always easy to
predict what might make a good p-s picture. I try to document the trip,
first of all. That means taking a lot of contextual pictures, not only
stunning views. But the best photos frequently make the best photo sketches.
<P>The "scenic" approach to scenery?</B>
In the studio I usually test a picture by printing it 11x17 and standing it
scenically with others on the mantelpiece. For artistic purposes the "good"
pictures are the ones that are intelligible and interesting from across the
room. What is this "across the room" quality? To my eye, it consists of a
recognisable and iconic structure, and often a kind of thematic quality.
<P>How about: Figures in a landscape?</B>
It doesn't have to be titled this way. But it helps me to imagine that a
picture could have some such wider association. Having some inkling of a
picture's thematic agenda could also help in the evaluation of the different
components of a picture, and in the studio work of taking a purely photo
image and decluttering, strengthening with line and tonal adjustments.

<BR clear='all'><BR><I>D226-224</I><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-224.jpeg">
<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Terraced Inca site.</B>

We begin to pass stupendous Inca sites like this one. The upper buildings
comprised storehouses and accommodation for workers and guard people. The
scalloped edges below apparently had some significance in Inca iconography.
Possibly to represent the coils of a serpent. The raised terrace would also
be above rainy season flood levels.

<I>V11-10-10</I> - <B>Terraced Inca site FX</B>

This illustrates a pitfall of using digital techniques to do what is very
close to what the sketcher or watercolourist often does. The tools here
emphasise edges. Natural scenes frequently have plenty of broken rock and
foliage and the challenge is to restrain the effects to essential details.
Otherwise the picture takes on the cluttered quality of an overworked sketch.

<I>09-06-18</I> - <B>Higher site.</B>

A higher site. Probably for surveillance and communications. The Inca Trail
was a highway linking settlements, hence the need for refreshment and relay
stations to serve commercial and administrative traffic. Hikers visible, left.

Just when I think we've left it all behind, more farmland. Looks like a

Hi Derek,

I enjoyed your presentation. Pretty sure your photo was of a Giant
Hummingbird. I base that mainly on the large bill. It is a bird of the
high mountains and is the largest of all hummingbirds.

This flower slightly resembles the lipstick plant sold as a potted houseplant
in Canada. However, unlike the lipstick plant, this doesn't have fuzzy petals
with a small club-like bend at the tip. We arrive at camp this evening so
late there's only a half-hour or so of daylight left to washup and pull
ourselves together. Dusk about 6:15pm.

The route down from Warmiwinuska Pass. The Inca Trail snakes down the right

These Inca steps carved into the rock are original, not dug out by the parks
department. As they still do for us today, they once helped Inca porters and
trekers to cope with constant changes of grade.

This comes close to abstract, but for me, the effect works because it uses
less information to evoke the same or even an enhanced idea of the original

The morning of our last day we're wakened at 4:30am. We stumble around the
crowded campground in the dark, looking for washrooms and breakfast. Then we
head for the exit where we stand in line in the dark with headlamps glowing.
There we wait at a closed gate monitored by a parks official till we can be
released to stampede down the trail toward Machu Picchu.
 This formality is to prevent people from attacking the trail too early and
either falling off a cliff in the near total darkness, or arriving at the
site before opening time. Or, perhaps, they want us to get there at just the
right psychological moment. Nobody seems to know exactly what's going on.

The site was probably covered at the time of discovery by the kind of brush

thatching. Visiting the sites of classical antiquity, you get used to ruins
with only the bare lower courses of foundations showing. But the buildings in

Angelo explains how they split the rock without the equipment we take for
granted today. Locating the cleavage planes, holes were chiselled and wooden
wedges inserted. These, when wetted, would then crack the rock along the
cleavage plane. So if you knew and respected the nature of the rock, you could
accomplish what would otherwise take an awful lot of brute force hacking.

See those 5 small stones embedded in the rock wall? Steps to permit Inca

in other parts of the site. This detail brings home our common mentality.
I've just made a resolution to never again bad-mouth the "stone age". As if
this was a period full of flintstone-like, knuckle-dragging primitives.

The Urubamba River again. Notice the pattern of steps on the right ridge.

These walls look almost too fresh and new to have survived from the 16th

with loving care. It looks almost like a contemporary building project in
progress, waiting for the roofs and interiors to be finished.

Several stones like this on the site, reflecting nearby mountain profiles.

<I>09-06-22</I> - <B>Serious stone-masonry.</B>

A fine example of Inca masonry. Hard to fit a knife blade between many of
these stones. How did the Incas do this? I don't think I've heard a definitive
answer. Probably not just a genius for predicting how a stone would fit, then
somehow carving it ahead of time, and having it miraculously TURN OUT to fit.
I suspect they had a practical trial-and-error method. ...
 For instance: trying the fit, seeing the discrepancy, removing the stone,
taking material off to improve the fit, repeating this to get as close as
desired. In addition, the stones could be roughly dished where they meet. If
one face was dished more than its corresonding face, then the stones would
meet only along a narrower outer edge. This could then be speedily trimmed
from the outside without repeatedly removing the stone from its position.

Hard to get near the stone, particularly with that tape round the edge to
keep us from putting paws on it. An enterprising guide is trying to suggest
to this young group that it may radiate a mysterious force. He has everybody
close their eyes and hold out palms to feel for the emanations emitted by
this rock of power.

The faces have been allowed to show through the outline effect. The picture
is also brighter, contrastier and sharper than the original. But it dispenses
with a small amount of (hopefully irrelevant) detail. Generally, the outline
effect lends itself more easily to subjects or artifacts that have close to
regular shapes, such as, architecture, masonry, horizons, clothing.

I don't feel any emanations, but certainly do feel the significance of the
thing. It's a focal point of such a vast sytem of terraces and buildings, of
a trail traversed for hundreds of years by runners, porters and pilgrims up
to the present day. It would be hard NOT to be focussed on this object, even
if you don't know its exact cultural significance

On the high altar platform, Merle is standing in front of a typical Inca
window. We're not quite sure if this taper was a purely aesthetic preference
or a structural issue. The lintel stone could be smaller than with a purely
rectangular window, and the form would approach a little closer to the ideal
of an arch.

Do these house walls look like the mountain profiles behind them? The Inca

The use of outlining here is obvious. The identity of the blocks, their huge

The effect here is subtle. You might not even guess that the original photo

plus the slight watercolour-ish blending and brightening of the colour areas

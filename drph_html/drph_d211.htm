<BR> * Hike to the top of the bank.
<BR> * Wonderful views, the Yukon River.

<BR> * Evacuated, float plane to Whitehorse.
<BR> * Proletarian paddlers: Good riddance.

<BR>
<BR><B>2008-07-22, Tuesday</B>  Slept in till 7:30. A day in camp. What to do. High thin
clouds with blue patches. Eggs with ham McMuffin for brekkie. Ablutions.
Plans are afoot to explore the paths leading inland from the river bank.
<BR>
<BR>A small group heads up the bank behind the telegraph station. Very steep red
earth. Then we bushwhack up moss-covered slopes to a summit on the edge of
an old cutbank. Good views of the Yukon and Teslin Rivers merging. I take a
panorama picture for assembly back home. We gather firewood on the way back
down the bank to camp.
<BR>
<BR>Hoot is repopulated in summer time with many groups of paddlers, but there's
room for a fair number of tents.
<BR>
<BR>In the afternoon another tour group lands from a natty glass-covered
powerboat out of Whitehorse. Ten people are picked up by two float-planes.
Elegant little birds, but with all those passengers they seem to take forever
to get airborne. The planes have to head up the Teslin River almost at tree
level before they disappear, circle, then reappear coming in the opposite
direction at higher altitude. Our people have given then the slightly
stand-offish reception that they richly deserve for affording a safari that
costs more per day than we have spent on a week.
<BR>
<BR>That evening, stories round the campfire about travel horror shows, bus
breakdowns, lost luggage. London, England instead of London, Ontario, that
sort of thing. Enough material for a book.

<BR>Our camp is in shadow from the hills in back. But we still have at least
another hour of daylight remaining.
<B><P>Day 6, Hootalinqua Island.</B>
<BR> * Hootalinqua I, steamer graveyard.
<BR> * Steamboats pulled out for winter.
<BR> * The Norcom, now a ruin.
<BR> * Getting better at canoe handling.
<BR> * Camp at Big Salmon. Campfire.
<BR> * Movie nostalgia. Travel horrors.
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR><B>2008-07-23, Wednesday</B>  We leave Hooterlingua for Big Salmon, cloudy-dull. A few
minutes paddling downstream and we stop at Hootalinqua Island to view the
wreck of the Norcom. This steamer is still up on blocks, but rapidly falling
into ruin as the weather disintegrates its woodwork. Len Webster says he
remembers when it was still safe to clamber aboard and explore. Today the
whole structure is near collapse. You could fall through the hull with the
ship's iron boiler coming down on top of you.
<BR>
<BR>More paddling and rafting, rafting and paddling... We make camp above a steep
ten foot gravel bank. Merle and I execute the "cut" manoever to perfection
this time. Like clockwork. A precision landing on a narrow gravel shelf.
Everyone pitches in pitching heavy packs up the bank where more hands are
waiting to haul the gear to safety. The canoes are pulled out and tied down.
Our tents go up in record time. Golly, we're getting efficient at this. The
sun is peeking through holes in the cloud cover by dinner time. We spend
hours nostalgizing about old movies round the campfire this evening.

<BR> * Old dredge site, tailings visible. 
<BR> 
<BR>
<BR> <B>2008-07-24, Thursday, day 7</B>  We depart Big Salmon. Cloudy-bright, briefly sunny. In
the afternoon I try "drafting" behind Kelly, the leader in our formation.
Following very closely, no more than ten feet behind another canoe does
seem to make progress slighly easier. The downside is that you use up a lot
of nervous energy attempting to track the sometimes erratic movements of
the leader. I remember trying this during a ten mile footrace in Welland.
I accidently stepped on the heel of my windbreak's running shoe and had to
sprint from there on to avoid his wrath.
<BR>
<BR>We camp at Twin Creeks after the usual "cut" manoever to land the canoes.
The current is sluicing by the campsite at about 10km and hour. I drop a
paddle over the side and have to leap into the water for it. Luckily only up
to the knees. Dry two hours later.
<BR>
<BR>This is an old dredging site, "windrows" of tailings still visible under the
moss. Another rest day tomorrow. We have only about 20km to go before the
final pull out. Some of the others will go on to camp at Carcross where they
will continue on down river to Dawson.

<BR>
<BR> <B>2008-07-25, Friday, day 8</B>  Twin Creeks, rest day. It drizzles all night, some
sun in the morning. Today, Judy, one of our trippers sees a lynx on the
riverbank. I wander up and down looking at ruined cabins. One
is still fixable. This area has quite a few good campsites with firepits and
logs arranged for sitting. This reminds me what a hunger I have for somewhere
comfortable to sit. Something with a back to lean against. Our Kansas
campers have comfy-looking director's chairs, awkward shapes but easy to tie
onto the top of a canoe load.
<BR>
<BR>Too much napping today, restless for action. Wine for supper. Mood subdued,
or simply tired? It is the end of this leg of the trip for Merle and I. Four
of our number are not going on to Dawson. I sit on the butt of a poplar tree
on the riverbank and meditate on the human condition. The river sluices past.
Who can step into the same river twice? (Heracleitos) Since we've been
camping at this sport, yesterday's water has moved 200 or more kilometers
closer to the sea. But the river is still not empty and the sea is not
filled. What gives?

to Whitehorse via lunch at Braeburn Lodge. 
<BR>
<BR>The usual confusion at the Best Western desk when we arrive, but eventually
we're established in our room to sort gear. Miriam and Adonis are at the
Yukon Inn. We've arranged to meet with the returnees from both the Teslin
and Chilkoot groups at the Fin and Fur resto for a dinner reunion. This is a
mere five hours after saying goodbye to some of them.

<BR>
<BR> <B>2008-07-27, Sunday</B>   Merle and I walk up the hill to the car rental depot near the
airport and drive back down for lunch. We then head for Zuchini(?) Hot
Springs to soak out the accumulated stiffness of our canoe trip. In line for
tickets with scads of Cherman Sprachers. The air in the pool area is cool but
the water pleasantly warm, even <I>hot</I> in the inlet area. Distant snow clad peaks
on the horizon, many kids playing. It seems that the locals come here as
well as the tourists. You can purchase a season pass. Apparently the place is
open in the winter. What fun, after a heavy day of dog-team mushing,
snow-machine repairs, or stoking the boilers of abandoned steamboats on the
marge of Lake Laberge.
<BR>
<BR>Miriam and Adonis are catching a flight home this evening. But we still have
two more days for tourist reconaissance, options Kluane and Atlin.
<BR>
<BR>On the way back to Whitehorse we detour to the shores of Lake Laberge.
Spectacular spot to camp of have a cottage. Plenty of open water and rocky
shorelines to explore. Might even be a good spot to have a sailboat. 
<BR>
<BR>Later that afternoon we explore Miles Canyon, upstream from the power
generating station. Water levels have been raised by the dam, so the canyon
is not as deep as it used to be. Powerboats come through it full throttle.
Nothing like the hazard to navigation of the olden days,
although of course, you can't get past the power dam without a portage. So
this is, in effect, the upper limit to navigation on the Yukon River. Below
this point, you could, I believe, drift, paddle or motor all the
way to the Bering Strait.

<BR>In fine weather, the lake has none of the grim associations of "that night
on the marge of Lake Laberge, that I cremated Sam McGee." This is cottage
country for Whitehorse people. Off the Alaska Highway, these views are taken
from a pleasant campsite near the shore.

<BR> <B>2008-07-28, Monday</B>  Well breakfasted, we head off to Kluane country,
specifically, Kathleen Lake. Arriving about 11am we set out to hike up the
King's Throne, an impressive cirque round the side of the lake. Park rangers
engaged in a parking lot project look at us sceptically and quote times of
two to four hours for the hike. They don't say if this is one way or return.
We take two hours fifteen minutes going up.
<BR>
<BR>Many photo panoramas and wildflower pictures later we arrive at the cirque
with snowbanks still present from last winter. The trail is fairly good
although quite steep on the upper reaches. We get temporarily lost on the
way back down to the lake and are pointed in the right direction by
francophone hikers from Quebec. Plan "B" would have been to continue
downhill to the shore of the lake where the campground would be
visible down the shore. This is our first serious climb of the year.
<BR>
<BR>We continue north on the Alaska Highway to a point just past Haines Junction.
From this vicinity, enormous mountains are visible in the west. One peak,
standing above the others, is entirely covered in snow and ice. At a Parks
Canada World Heritage Site, we can't see the view for the shrubbery in the
way. Do they have a fixation about not cutting trees? I've noticed this in
many "scenic" locations in other parts of the country. How about a little
"landscaping" to make the scenery visible.
<BR>
<BR>We head "home" to Whitehorse.

<BR>"Fred felt Nora's hot breath on his shoulder and knew that they were about to
exchange the bow and stern paddling positions for the less familiar midships
position."
<BR>
<BR>Sorry, wrong story. We opt for a trip to Atlin, B.C. on our last full day in
the Yukon. This is off the Trans Canada and south down 60km of fair quality
gravel road. The route skirts lakes along the way, has some nice picnic
sites, but only a few good views. The road is mostly winding through treed
alleyways of the kind I thought we'd left behind in Ontario.
<BR>
<BR>But Atlin itself is a gem, a decrepit, undervisited, but picturesque lakeside
town with boats, floatplanes, a campground, a museum, and very fine Alpine
vistas across the water. No restos are open and we have to buy lunch stuff
at a grocery store. You can make this a base of operations for trips round
the lake, or to the glaciers and high country on the opposite side. Atlin
had its own goldrush after the Klondike, and afterwards supported a large
tourist industry via a steamer crossing the lake with connections to
Whitehorse.
<BR>

<BR><B>2008-07-30, Wednesday</B>  On our last day, we visit the old Anglican log church,
then later, hear a retelling of local biography in the town cemetery.
Afterwards we stroll around town, listless. Not quite hungry enough for
lunch, not quite keen enough to find anything fascinating to do. Such is the
final day of airline passengers waiting for an evening flight. Too tired for
a serious walk, we check out of the hotel. A rental car is now our only base
of operations.
<BR>
<BR>We drive to the Beringia Museum in the afternoon. We learn that large areas 
of the Yukon and central Alaska were not glaciated in the ice age. They
formed what is called a "mammoth steppe". This was a boreal grassland where
herd animals and their predators could survive. An area cold but relatively
dry in the rain-shadow of the coastal mountains. The fertility required to
support a grassland was supplied by drifting soil called "loess" carried by
the wind from glacial deposits to the west. All this changed with the retreat
of the glaciers. Fertility dropped, the soil became more acid, forests took
over, and the area could no longer support the lifestyles of the large herd
animals who required a steppe habitat.
<BR>
<BR>We relinquish the rental car in the airport parking lot. After a brief
attempt to visit the Transportation Museum at closing time, we sit in the
airport lounge eating chunks of cheese and waiting for our fate with Air
Canada. The bags that were checked free of charge on the outbound journey now
cost us $30 extra to return. My attention wanders away from such irritating
trivia. I drift back to those long stretches of the Teslin River, with the
current speeding us across Beringia and toward the Bering Strait.

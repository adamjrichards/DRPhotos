0219-31 83-08-17 - Missouri R. ahead.</P>

<P>        We reach the valley of the Missouri.  But before we see
the river itself, there is a subtle impression of greater
visibility to the south, of the land sloping down to some basin
below the line of sight. Then we see the lake formed by the
Garrison Dam.  We drive alongside and continue on its left bank
below the dam to ---[?]. There we cross the Missouri and drive
north up the opposite side. Above the dam, the terrain doesn't
look as you expect since Lake Sakakawea innundates the valley up
to the level of the surrounding tableland.

us, is the familiar valley of celebrated by balladeers and
story-tellers: majestic bluffs on either side, rich bottom land,
a massive flow of water between banks lined with cottonwood and
willow.

Before reaching the site of the original native village we visit Lewis and

<P>        We continue northwest looking for the turnoff to the
site of the Mandan village.  On the left is a rolling bluff
carpeted with dry prairie grass.  We turn at a modest signpost and
reach an ordinary-looking bit of pasturage on the old river
bank. Beside the entrance to the property, is a mobile home
which is the headquarters of the park attendant.  We drive along a
track through the grass and come to the edge of the bank where
we park at an interpretive booth.

representing the remains of the original Mandan lodges.

0220-11 83-08-17 - The old riverbank</P>

<P>        I stroll to the bank of the river.  The relentless flood
that passed this point in historical times has long receded.  Today the
actual riverbank is a half mile distant; below me is a boggy
mass of reeds and a few sluggish streams.  The Missouri lies
hidden beyond a line of distant cottonwoods.
<P>        I look for recognisable features. The bank comes to a
point, jutting out over the damp thickets below. I scramble down
into the underbrush and struggle out into the open to where I
can see the bank in profile.  I try to imagine the underbrush
stripped away, the Missouri rolling past the high bluff where I
stood a moment before.
<P>        There is a certain painting, done by Bodmer I think.
Two Mandan women are launching a skin boat immediately below a
steep promontory.  At the top is a palisade with glimpses of
domed earth lodges.  It is then I hear the whispering of the
ghosts of a past which I have spent so long recreating in my own
imagination. I visualize the sweat lodge on the shore, hear the
sounds of a numerous population above.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0220/0220-17.jpeg">
0220-17 83-08-17 - Some lodge sites still visible.</P>

<P>        I press through the reeds and struggle back up the bank, up a cleft
in the old shoreline which seems inexplicably familiar.  Just like what I'd
imagined in the novel. On an open field where the grass has been mowed we see
the circular depressions of vanished lodges, as shown on the site map.  It
was on the roofs of these vanished lodges that the visiting white men sat on
the first day of their visit as they looked out over the village, meditating
the amazing scene about them.
<P>        In the centre of the cluster of circular depressions is
an open space; near its edge is a particular circle, perhaps a little
larger than the others. So it was here, I imagine, that James
Fielding witnessed the initiation rituals of the Okipa.  In this
circle, where I now stand, the youths were hoisted skyward by the
pierced flesh of their pectoral muscles. And beyond the expanse
of grass, past a long ditch that must once have been the village
palisade and moat, lie the bluffs. From somewhere up there in
the territory of the buffalo, Lone Man would have appeared to
make his way down to the village at the start of the Okipa.

<P>        And somewhere out there, James Fielding crouched low in
the grasses, searching for the Medicine Man's son after the
torture of the youths was over.  I see a patch of trees that
might once have been a slough. It could have been there that he
located the exhausted boy and protected him from those who
threatened harm.

0220-05 83-08-17 - Only a few pathetic remains.</P>

<P>        We examine the ground. Scattered about are small piles of
bleached bones, whether gathered by treasure-hunters, rodents or
archaeologists we cannot tell; the soil is rich with fragments
of white, the substance of generations of animals and men - the
knuckle bones of those forgotten ancestors of men who have left
no descendants.  The raised burial platforms of the Indians are
gone; the Mandans are gone, exterminated by disease, their last
tribal lands innundated under the headpond of the Garrison dam.
<P>        We chat with the young man who maintains the site. He
provides useful bibliographical references and the suggestion
that we visit other sites in the vicinity.  Further north along
the riverbank, at Cut Knife Creek, is the site of a Hidatsa
village, another tribe of the region, also dwelling in earth
lodges. Here there is an interpretive centre and an earth lodge
recreated to scale. In the yard of the interpretive centre,
members of the buckskin fraternity demonstrate the frontier
crafts of leather tanning, black powder shootin' while dressed
in period costume.
<P>        We cross over to the north bank and locate Fort
Clark[?], a recreation of the original fort erected by the Lewis
and Clark expedition in the winter of 1804-5[?].  The river bank
has been graded and reinforced at this point but in the distance
on the opposite side I think I can see the bluff on which the
Mandan village stood.

along Highway 1804, we seek out a campsite for the night among the
badlands on the north shore of Lake Sakakawea.

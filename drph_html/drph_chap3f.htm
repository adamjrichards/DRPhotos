<P>    A plume of smoke rose from the opposite side of a small
island. It seemed almost close enough inshore to wade out to.
But James had learned a rule of wilderness etiquette that
requires visitors at an unfamiliar camp to observe caution
before bursting in uninvited. He walked silently on the pine
needles where he wouldn't be noticed in the shadows. From
further along he could see the island's other shore. Two people
were sitting placidly on the rocks, apparently fishing. A fire
smouldered behind them, suggesting cooking preparations. He
decided to reveal himself and give them a good-day.
<P>    To avoid any appearance of furtive approach, he came out of
the trees, sat down on a boulder and waved. An Indian man and
woman turned and watched him without movement. A small child,
bare from the waist down, sprang out of the bushes opposite and
stared in wide-eyed astonishment. Mrs. Maidstone was nowhere in
sight.
<P>    "Nice fish you've got there." James hadn't eaten for over
24 hours.
<P>    "Yup." The man shrugged toward the flat rocks where the
day's catch was laid out.
<P>    "You know Landry, out on the bay?"
<P>    A flicker of recognition. "You from the canoe brigade? ...
Up here huntin'?" 
<P>    "... We were delayed. I thought I'd come up and look
around."
<P>    "You see anythin' ... interestin'?" The man's tone conveyed
a slight hint of sarcasm.
<P>    "... Perhaps. I was up on the high ridges for a time. In
some places you can see inland over these lakes. And all the way
back out to the Bay -- the whole district at once." He was
suddenly conscious that his explanations would probably seem
childish.
<P>    But the Indian seemed satisfied. "Makin' med'cine, eh? Yup,
had to go off alone like that myself before I could become a
warrior. Commune with the spirits." Then he settled down again
to stare at the point where his line entered the water. 
<P>    This seemed to conclude the shouted interview, but James
still hadn't discovered the main object of his bushwhacking:
Mrs. Maidstone. Or had it actually been she? The distance was
too great to tell for certain. Perhaps the fisherman's wife had
been wearing some other garment that looked from a distance like
Mrs. Maidstone's serviceable black. Possibly the fisherman had
dropped off a companion en route. Or -- terrible thought --
perhaps the lady had strolled off and taken some injury along
the way.
<P>    He stared across at them, now more anxious than ever to
broach the subject of Mrs. Maidstone. There were also those
delicious-looking fish lying on the rocks, and a fire going ...
<P>    The man looked up again and swept his arm behind him in an
explanatory arc. "Hey, you lookin' for a woman?"  James was
briefly non-plussed. <I>Surely</I> he wasn't suggesting ... "That
white woman ... We brought her up from the bay this mornin'. She
took some paper and writin' things with her. Said she was gonna
make pitchers. She's up there on the mountain somewhere. We're
waitin' for her. Have to go back down tomorrow. Brigade's
leavin'." 
<P>    James' guiltily repudiated his initial assumption. Then his
mind took another startled leap, landing full in the middle of
that web of entanglements he thought he'd left behind at
Landry's Bay. Incredulous, he pressed the Indian further. "Mrs.
Maidstone? You mean to say she's up there on the mountain?
sketching?" The fisherman got up and walked round the shore of
the island so they could talk more easily.
<P>    "I dunno what her name is. She was on that schooner anchored
off the rocks. Said she come over last night from Landry's Bay
with her husband and some men from the canoe brigade. We got
there this mornin'. Nearly had a fight with the people in that
ship. The one on deck cleanin' a rifle, the mouthy one, he told
me to clear out. ... <I>Me</I>. I been livin' round here longer than
Landry. Used to work for the Indian Department in the war. Got a
red coat and a medal. Yup."
<P>    Unlike the traditional laconic Indian, this man seemed to
want to talk. James got the feeling that he was bemusedly trying
to re-establish some earlier fraternal bond with a rare specimen
of rational white society.
<P>    "That woman said she wanted to go into the bush and see
things for herself. The fella with her, he got pretty mad. Said
he was damn well goin' back to Landry's place without her. And
the ship was gonna hafta make sail westward before we got back,
and leave her behind. On the way up here, she told us she was
s'posed to stay on that ship, so she could go back east again,
when they got as far as the falls, up at St. Mary's, where the
ship was s'posed to turn back. She didn't want to go back, no
way... Hell, <I>you</I> don't want to hear all this."
<P>    "Oh, <I>yes</I>, yes indeed. Please go on."
<P>    "Well then, things got pretty loud. She told him he
was an idiot, 'cause the people back at Landry's would worry
that something bad might have happened to her when he came back
with some crazy story, without her. Then she called me over close
to the ship and they all got into arguin' at the same time.
That was when the one cleanin' the rifle started givin' me hell.
For just <I>bein'</I> there ... Hell, I wasn't even sayin' anythin'."
<P>    Here the fisherman broke into a smile. "She talks real good,
shut them all up pretty quick. Climbed down into the canoe. Paid
us good money to bring her up here."
<P>    James longed for his writing things so he could jot down the
salient facts and divine their significance later on. But
unfortunately, he'd lost his knapsack when his canoe had been
sunk.
<P>    The Indian turned and pointed down the shore. "I told her
about the lake up on the mountain. Showed her the way to climb
up. Maybe you better go fetch her. Make sure she gets down here
in time for supper. Startin' to get dark in two-three hours."
<P>    James nodded and began to walk along the shore to the point
indicated. There, he cast about for footprints. Under the gloom
of the pine trees he located a track. A small boot had left its
print, tracing a beeline path through the forest. Here and
there, disturbances in the pine needles indicated the wearer of
that boot had pulled down considerable litter before finding a
way up.  He could almost hear her muttering in vexation at the
fate that had given women such unhandy garments.
<P>    Several hundred feet up, the track crossed a rocky area and
vanished.  Repeatedly, he circled around, unable to pick up her
trail again.  The shadowy gloom increased, with a late afternoon
sun slanting along the flank of the north-facing slopes,
preventing sunlight from reaching the forest floor. He pictured
a disoriented Mrs. Maidstone wandering aimlessly in the hills.
Surely she'd have the sense to follow the downward slope back to
the lake and stand on the shore hallooing for help.
<P>    The upper lake was nowhere to be seen and James climbed
higher up the hillside with growing anxiety. Then, below him, he
saw a flash of reflected sunlight through the trees. He'd
overshot the mark and now turned to make good the error. The
lake proved to be a small, sunlit pond of clear water,
precariously hung on the shoulder of the mountain. This forest
pool was prevented from spilling over the edge by nothing more
than a lip of rock overlooking the greater lake below. As he
made his way through the pines, the sounds of splashing stopped
him in his tracks. He crept toward a fringe of bushes at the
margin of the pond, expecting to surprise some shy woodland
creature at its toilette. 
<P>    The element of surprise was complete on both sides. Below
him, Mrs. Maidstone lay immersed up to her neck in crystal
water, clothes laid out neatly on the stones. James was at a
loss whether to retreat to the bushes or offer a polite
how-d'you-do and carry on. He loomed above her, not certain
which way to look. The pond was hardly more than a large bathing
tank and offered little concealment.
<P>    She let out a startled shriek, caught her breath and plunged
beneath the surface. There she remained, submerged longer and
deeper than he would have thought possible, bubbles rising from
the spot where she'd gone down. Then he saw hands fanning the
water and a face with startled eyes rising cautiously to the
surface.  Her head bobbed up. She gasped and blinked, water
streaming from her face.
<P>    "James, is it really you? I thought you were some half-naked
wildman of the hills. You <I>are</I> a sight."
<P>    The sun was at her back and shining in his eyes. He'd lost
the advantage of surprise. Looking down, he began to see what
she meant. He was bare-chested and mosquito-bitten, having
removed and forgotten his shirt earlier in the day while
climbing a precipice. The caked blood of assorted minor
injuries, the sweaty grime of pine forests and peat bogs
decorated his hide. Running exploratory fingers through his
hair, he discovered a sprig of pine needles in the matted locks
behind his left ear. This he disentangled while trying to
explain things as casually as he could.
<P>    "I met a family of Indians on an island down in the lower
lake. They said a white woman had come up here to do some
sketching. I assumed it must be you." 
<P>    She ignored his wooden explanations. "You certainly look a
proper Caliban. How ever did you get into such a condition?" 
<P>    "Oh, ... scaled a cliff. Waded a swamp or two." He was
beginning to feel as if he were answering to his mother after
one of his escapades back home in Kingston. He barely suppressed
the automatic, lying response of an errant schoolboy: "Oh,
nothing much."
<P>    "Do help me out of the water."
<P>    She extended an arm. Stepping to a half-submerged rock he
prepared to assist, glancing wildly in every direction for an
acceptable spot to park his eyes. She crept nearer the edge, and
as she emerged, he turned his head ashamedly the other way,
groping blindly forward with one hand to take up her weight.
<P>    A vicious pull jerked him off balance. He described a neat
trajectory and fell at full length, creating a small tidal wave
that wet the nearby banks. Inhaling a noseful of frigid water,
he came up spluttering and rubbing his eyes.  When finally done
with choking, he turned to see the lady laughing merrily.
<P>    "<I>That</I> was for frightening me half out of my wits. You are
well repaid," she called over her shoulder, paddling toward the
opposite side as if she expected him to chase her in a game of
tag.
<P>    He turned his back and began to sluice icy water over his
head. At least he could profit from the dunking by doing
something to amend his piratical appearance.  A thoroughly
disquieting woman, he thought, plucking more pine needles out of
his hair. 
<P>    But now her voice was close behind him. "You've done
yourself a hurt."
<P>    Her concern sounded almost genuine. Her finger traced the
outline of a bad scrape on his back. He'd gotten it tumbling
backward while ascending a dangerous chimney in a vertical cliff
-- a foolhardy detour. Now the cold water was making it sting
again. He stolidly resumed sluicing water over his chest,
careful not to look around. Her hands lightly brushed the skin
round the cut and splashed water on his back to wash off the
caked blood.
<P>    "And what have you done to your lip?" She came round to face
him. He continued to stare into the water. 
<P>    "Thought I was going to fall down a hundred foot cliff. Must
have hugged a rock ... a little too lovingly, I guess."
<P>    He made a weak smile, glanced quickly at her face and began
to contemplate his ragged fingers, a tracery of scratches and
punctures.  She dabbed at his mouth, her disembodied arm
protruding above the water, the neck of a white swan. Wet hair
clung to her shoulders and trailed in the water.
<P>    "Mind, it still feels a bit thick." He winced as she ran her
fingers over his lip. 
<P>    "And now that you've conquered the wilderness, what d'you
have to show for it?" Her tone was indulgent; her other hand,
unseen in the water, soothed the tender part of his back. 
<P>    He looked directly into her eyes for the first time and
tried to explain what he'd seen. "At one point, I lay on the
brink of a cliff and imagined what it would be like to be an
eagle. I could have swooped down over all those lakes and out
toward the Bay."
<P>    Immediately he'd said it, he felt juvenile. This was not the
kind of talk heard in the drawing rooms of country squires and
merchants, still less in the wardrooms of the King's regiments. 
<P>    But she regarded him without ridicule, and her hand slipped
to his waist. "Tell me more. How many lakes could you see?" 
<P>    He told her briefly of his long scramble up and down cliffs
and along ridges ... to intercept her. He said nothing about how
he'd come to lose his canoe. All the while, under water, her
fingers busied themselves lightly brushing debris from his sides
and chest. She noticed the gooseflesh rising on his body.
<P>    "You'll take a chill." She pressed her palms against his
skin. 
<P>    "Don't <I>you</I> feel the cold?"
<P>    "A little ... but the sun was so unseasonably warm today ...
and the water so inviting ... and I felt so hot and dusty ..."
She hesitated, took his hand in hers and with an air of generous
bestowal, brought it down to her waist and pressed it there.
"... Do you see? I'm not so cold."
<P>    He stared at her in alarm as something like a voltaic shock
radiated from a point under his diaphragm, ran all through his
body and ended with a tingling sensation in his extremities. He
knew it was not the water's chill he felt. She too gave a look
of fearful recognition, then came close and touched his split
lip with hers. As they drew together, her breasts brushing his
chest, his hands fell downward to her hips. They clung together
for a long bewildered moment, fingers searching for proper
resting places. 
<P>    To his delighted horror, she began tugging downward at his
belt. In a mood of delirious cooperation, he impulsively
jettisoned trousers and boots and in the process choked down a
few more mouthfuls of water. They came up together laughing, she
wrapping her legs about his waist while he danced across the
bottom, heedlessly stubbing benumbed toes on submerged stones.
<P>    Gliding like minnows, their fingers nibbled each other's
bodies. The cold was forgotten. In the watery depths, her skin
seemed to take on a strange glistening texture, annointed with
some unimaginable potion of arousal. This was a substance that
speedily entered the pores of his own skin and insinuated itself
directly into his bloodstream. Then she leaned away from him in
the water. The breasts he'd hardly dared dream about surfaced
and resurfaced -- the floating islands of Homeric legend. Over
this watery kingdom, his hands sculled back and forth, like the
dilatory Odysseus, beaching repeatedly on landfalls of infinite
fascination. He floated her on his palms, turning her this way
and that, lifting her body part way out of the water just to see
the cascades run down her silvery flanks. 
<P>    She took his hand and drew him shoreward. As she emerged,
Venus -- or was it Circe? -- rising from the waves, he hung back
squatting in the shallows.
<P>    "Come with me," she urged. 
<P>    "I can't ... that is, I'm ... not decent." He flushed red.
<P>    She returned to the water to seize his hand. Dragging him to
his feet, she led the embattled Ensign up the bank, colours
bravely flying. Hand in hand at the top of the lip of stone that
contained the pool, they looked out over the larger lake.
Jumping from rock to rock, she led the way to a protected niche,
carpeted with bushy grass. She pulled him down beside her and
they lay together, peering over the edge at the lake and its
dotted islands. 
<P>    "Is this what it was like, in the place where you were
climbing?"
<P>    "This is far more picturesque. If I really were an eagle,
I'd swoop down, and ..."
<P>    "Then swoop. My very <I>picturesque</I> eagle."
<P>    The world flipped inside out as all his far-ranging senses
seemed to bend inward toward that beckoning form. Her eyes, too,
were bright and watchful, and with the few shreds of reason that
remained, he wondered who was swooping on whom. She held out her
arms; he became her servant: a love-slave attuned to whatever
suggestion her body would make. When a dewy flank encroached, he
doted on it; when a breast loomed, he fondled it.  Should those
lips pout, ignored for a half-minute, he would placate them with
bloody kisses. Let a pair of splendid buttocks heave into view,
and he encircled her waist to hug their amplitude. But glimpses
of the scene beyond their couch broke in upon his narrowed
sensibility. While his fingers stole toward the mossy places
near at hand, his winged <I>other</I> still floated over the woolly
tops of pine trees far below.
<P>    "James, take me soaring with you," she breathed in his ear.
<P>    Grasped by the convenient handle of his manhood, he was
shocked by her bold grip and allowed himself to be drawn in.
Down he swooped between the ivory pillars of her raised thighs
as she pressed him home. His body glided over hers, the hairs of
his chest brushing up her belly and sweeping across her breasts.
Smoothly skimming that landscape of flesh, he vacated the
precarious aerie of reason at last.
<P>    With loins pressed together in a new revelation of
sensation, each experienced the certainty that the core of their
being had found its exact counterpart. The perfect key in the
ideal lock.  They remained pressed together for some moments,
each adjusting their body to gain some precious increment of
nearness. His nose buried in her neck, he watched a pulsating
vein out of one eye. With that signal of approval, he turned to
plant more kisses on her mouth. But nudging thighs urged him on
to greater discovery and his own hips were soon dappled with the
dancing silhouettes of spring grasses.
<P>
<P>    The long, downward glide ended and now he swam with eager
strokes into that siren maelstrom, singing out for its grateful
victim. Over the brink and sucked in, he plunged headlong down
those coiling walls. Joyfully he hurled himself inward, to roll
gasping in that rippling fluid, yearning to plant his essence
in the oozy depths. Beneath them, a steamy cavern opened. Into
it they fell, bodies melting together, turning to water as they
dropped through to the other side of the world.
<P>
<P>    For a time, her eyes remained closed in that brief death of
self that is the pinnacle -- or the bottomless well -- of love.
Her head pillowed on her arm and turned to one side, she
breathed serene. The ghost of a smile played at the corners of
her mouth.  He reclined watchfully on his elbow at her side and
passed his restless hand over her flanks, gazing at her and
beyond her to the prospect of the lake below. He made his
fingers into a pair of miniature legs and walked them across the
slopes. The mountaineer traversed one breast, then began a
tortuous ascent to its twin peak. Pirouetting on the final
summit, he made an unlucky step and slid down the slopes to an
imaginary dunking in the drops of pond water and sweat that had
collected in her navel.
<P>    "Sugarloaf Peak", I'd call it, ... if I were mapping
unexplored territory." Her eyes popped wide open.
<P>    "Sugarloaf Peak, is that the name of this hill?"
<P>    "There's a conical peak, somewhere east of Montreal, near
the Vermont border. I've seen it in sketches. Very symmetrical,
very lovely, overlooking a lake even bigger than this one. I
don't remember the name of it, but surely it can't compare to
this." 
<P>    She sat up and smiled appreciatively. "Please don't get
dressed," he begged. "I don't think I can get enough of looking
at you. If I were a real artist, I'd paint you just like that,
with the lake and mountains in the background." 
<P>    She got up and strode over to the brink, hands on hips.
"Like this, you mean?"
<P>    She took up a position at the edge of the drop and assumed
an artistic pose. The surface of the lake behind her seemed to
shimmer. James had more intimations of swooping flight. She
returned to his side and soothed his reawakened interest, as if
ministering to the comfort of some pet animal.
<P>    "Come, the shadows are lengthening, we must be away." Giving
him a reassuring, almost maternal kiss, she added, "Never fear,
there'll be another hill to climb, another day." 
<P>    He marvelled, watching her skip back to the edge of the pool
where he'd first interrupted her ablutions. She seemed to have
an abundance of energy as well as being impervious to cold. 
<P>    "Come on in, else everyone will scent what we've been up
to." She plunged into the icy water with a surge of foam.
<P>    A petticoat served as a cloth to dry her, and soon she was
dressed and collecting sketching things. Meanwhile, James sat
naked on a rock, in a reverie, following her elegant, cat-like
movements. The transformation from love-goddess to respectable
lady was remarkable.
<P>    Coming back to his wits, he called out: "Good God, my
trousers and boots. They're still at the bottom of the pond." He
looked imploringly in her direction.
<P>    She regarded him with arched brows. "Your appearance is
perfectly acceptable to <I>me</I> just as you are. However, I suspect
that our friends down at the lake, not to mention our companions
back at Landry's Bay, would be more than a little taken aback." 
<P>    "What'll I wear?" He stared at the freezing water,
visualizing how he'd look in borrowed petticoats or improvised
panels of birchbark. 
<P>    He waded cautiously into the pond and with repeated efforts
retrieved a sodden armload. Up-ending a boot, he poured out a
torrent of cold water, then plumped down on a rock and lowered
his head in post-amatory depression.  The world didn't look half
so hospitable, half an hour later. She began to laugh.  He
looked at her sideways.
<P>    "You <I>are</I> a heartless creature."
<P>    "Your very own heartless creature -- and bosom companion of
the last hour."
<P>    Attempting to force his feet into wet footgear, he hopped
about on one leg. Presently, he too began to laugh.
<P>    "You look a proper pirate now, sir." She regarded him clad
in nothing but a pair of high, wet cavalry boots. "Put your
hands on your hips, look ferocious, and I shall be the one to
paint <I>your</I> picture." 
<P>    He looked down and realized he'd now have to pull his boots
off again before he could get his trousers on. When he inched
the soggy garments up his legs, he broke into picturesque
exclamations of disgust -- all for her amusement.
<P>    They scrambled back down to the lower shore, returning to
the island at sundown. The Indian couple sat in exactly the same
positions James had left them. But the number of fish drying on
the rocks had greatly increased. He raised his hand in greeting.
The man spoke.
<P>    "Good thing you came back before dark. Gets cold up there at
night. Hold on, I'll come over'n get you." As they stepped from
the canoe onto the island, the man eyed James' damp attire.
That's a pretty clean pair of boots you got there, son. Ready
for anythin', I bet. ... Say, did the spirits visit you while
you were up on the mountain?"
<P>    "Spirits?"
<P>    "I thought, from what you said, that you were up there
makin' medicine. So you could become a warrior."
<P>    "Oh, that ..."
<P>    The stony face didn't move a muscle, but this time James
<I>knew</I> he was being satirized. He grinned through clenched teeth
and began to shiver.
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone to the rescue. "Such gallantry. My only
silk handkerchief blew in the water and Mr. Fielding <I>insisted</I>
on fetching it. Now we really must do something to dry him out."
<P>    By way of verification she quickly fluttered a square of
linen out of some interior recess of her clothing and just as
quickly stuffed it back in again. The cloth still had a needle
attached by a length of red embroidery thread.
<P>    He worried that she might prick those lovely breasts with
the needle.
<P>    "Time for supper, anyhow," said the fisherman. He coiled up
fishing lines and went to his canoe. "Take this blanket. We'll
dry out your clothes by the fire." His wife moved as if on cue
to the fireside and began adding sticks. 
<P>    James headed for the bushes, to return bundled in a
colourful fur trade blanket, holding in one hand a mass of damp
clothing. This was appropriated by the fisherman's wife who
propped up the boots on sticks and flattened trousers and linen
on a nearby rock where they were soon steaming in the heat. 
<P>    They sat by the fire and ate in silence, James stealing
glances at Mrs. Maidstone.  For her part, she ignored his
appreciative looks and emanated an air of mild toleration to all
that transpired.  He wondered what had happened to occasion this
abrupt change of heart.  It was only as she was seeking out a
separate place to bed down for the night that she gave him a
meaningful glance -- with a finger held to her lips.

<BR> * Joyce said that Arts Place used to be a gas station -- Art's
Place, till the Honsbergers bought it from Art and set up the gallery.
<BR> * Ray of light from above gives it an undersea look.
<BR> * Bubee and Zaydee on the wall look discontented. Sales have
been slow, despite the bargain-basement prices.
<BR> * in the peace and quiet of the gallery back room.
<P><B>2016-08-02 Lo-cal</B>
<BR> * As in predicting the future with Tarot cards.
<BR> * Or choose another. Lurking cat. Confused artist. The
mysterious background presence. Cycles suggesting escape.
<P><B>2016-08-02 Our Tuesday bike ride.</B>
<BR> * Would be best overall with previous best face.
<P><B>2016-08-05 Lo-cal again.</B>
<BR> * Needs only the bottle of cheap but nice sherry I used to hide in the
rockpile beside the bench.

<I>0299-09 86-08f</I> - <B>1940s: Our apartment house. Danville.</B>

<BR> * I used to hide in the top floor of that tower and read old National
Geographics from the 1920s. Already a staunch devotee of anachronism.
<BR> * Or, perhaps in this case, "Accordian in the dust". Can't find any internet
references to PS and "Harmonium..."
<BR> * Miriam and I found this hank of barbed-wire back in the late
'70s(?). We were on a practice drive (for my driver's licence)
somewhere east of Port Colborne where we visited a disused
quarry, while looking for fossils. And discovered this piece of
"found art". Probably left over from some long-ago fencing
project.

<I>D226-280 09-06-19</I> - <B>NOT Nazca lines. Old campsite drainage.</B><xxx>

<BR>Along the way we pass this view of the campsite we've just left behind. At
first I think this looks like some local version of Nazca lines. But the
inverted "V"-shaped features are drainage channels between tenting areas. The
idea is to make sure that water from the hillside above drains away from the
tents and into the little creek at the bottom.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-281.jpeg">
<I>D226-281 09-06-19</I> - <B>Looking back. A long ascent.</B><xxx>

<BR>The altitude is beginning to have its effect. We're rising steeply and
steadily now. A few hikers are visible on the path to the right.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-282.jpeg">
<I>D226-282 09-06-19</I> - <B>Stairway to heaven.</B><xxx>

<BR>These stairs are continuous from here on. Derek admits he has to take ten
steps and stop for breath, then repeat this sequence all the way to the top.
I, of course, as your disembodied narrator, am feeling quite fresh and full
of vigour. Now where are those coca leaves. My chewing wad needs a little
refreshment.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-283.jpeg">
<I>D226-283 09-06-19</I> - <B>The top of the pass in sight.</B><xxx>

<BR>The lucky ones who've already reached the summit wait on that little knoll
on the right.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-284.jpeg">
<I>D226-284 09-06-19</I> - <B>Ramparts, no detour possible.</B><xxx>

<BR>On either side of the trail, the highest peaks rake moisture out of the
passing clouds. The turf is thick and probably brilliant green in season. No
brush or trees survive at this altitude.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-285.jpeg">
<I>D226-285 09-06-19</I> - <B>Warmiwanusca Pass, 4200m.</B><xxx>

<BR>Finally a good view of the top. This is the Warmiwanusa pass, 4200 metres.
The name means Dead Woman Pass in Quechua.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-286.jpeg">
<I>D226-286 09-06-19</I> - <B>We toil upward.</B><xxx>

<BR>Derek begins to feel like he too might become a Peruvian place name. Don't
know if they'd rename this the Dead Guy Pass just for him. Ah, there's three of
our group. Franka, Merle and Angelo the guide coming up.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-289.jpeg">
<I>D226-289 09-06-19</I> - <B>Resting at the top.</B><xxx>

<BR>Derek finally reaches the summit along with the other hikers now catching
their breath. Angelo on the left waits for the rearguard. The weather goes
suddenly cold. Wind sluices up the pass from behind us and down this side. It
begins to rain and sleet.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-290.jpeg">
<I>D226-290 09-06-19</I> - <B>Pelted with sleet.</B><xxx>

<BR>As the squall moves over the pass, it passes down to the valley below,
creating a rainbow.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-291.jpeg">
<I>D226-291 09-06-19</I> - <B>Rainbow over the valley.</B><xxx>

<BR>A telephoto view. The campsite with the Nazca lines is halfway down. Farm
fields are visible at the very bottom.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-295.jpeg">
<I>D226-295 09-06-19</I> - <B>Looks so much easier in retrospect.</B><xxx>

<BR>Looking back, as the weather passes over and the clouds part. The smile of
the Sun-god works wonders to dispel fatigue.
<BR>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-297.jpeg">
<I>D226-297 09-06-19</I> - <B>The other side of the pass.</B><xxx>

<BR>We take a look over the opposite side of the pass, along with el condor up in
the sky on the left. This is what's ahead for the rest of the afternoon.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-297A.jpeg">
<I>D226-297A V11-10-10</I> - <B>Just follow el Condor. FX</B><xxx>

<BR>Here the outline effect keeps away from the clouds, emphasizing the airy
environment of the condor, upper left.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-298.jpeg">
<I>D226-298 09-06-19</I> - <B>A good trail down.</B><xxx>

<BR>A marvellous example of Inca engineering aided
no doubt by the Peru parks department. Smoothly paved with well-fitting stones.
Steep but comfortable underfoot.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-299.jpeg">
<I>D226-299 09-06-19</I> - <B>A bit exposed up here.</B><xxx>

<BR>We really feel at one with the elements. Wraiths of cloud go
swishing by us on our way down.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-300.jpeg">
<I>D226-300 09-06-19</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>A standout bit of rock, at home in the clouds.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-300A.jpeg">
<I>D226-300A </I> - <B>FX</B><xxx>

<BR>Another abstract picture. I had no idea till this picture popped up on my
screen how the qualities of the outline effect could show elemental forces at
work in a cloudscape. The swirly edges of the clouds seem to suggest power and
determination.  
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-306.jpeg">
<I>D226-306 09-06-19</I> - <B>Angelo snaps the final shot.</B><xxx>

<BR>Take a good look. We'll never see that side of the pass again.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-310.jpeg">
<I>D226-310 09-06-19</I> - <B>We start down the opposite side.</B><xxx>

<BR>Merle in the lead.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-313.jpeg">
<I>D226-313 09-06-19</I> - <B>Thirsty wayfarer, slaking.</B><xxx>

<BR>From another group. The trail stretches ahead for miles and miles. This is
part of the joy of high altitude hiking. The ability to see far ahead and to
anticipate a route. It's not an ordinary experience for most of us. We go
through our days beset by the close details of life, without any far-reaching
vision of where we're going, or why.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-319.jpeg">
<I>D226-319 09-06-19</I> - <B>The path leads on ... forever?</B><xxx>

<BR>We begin to see more flowers on this downward leg of the trail. They're
sustained by moisture from those clouds that just finished dampening our
rain-gear, which we now have to remove as the temperature rises on the
descent. That's our trail going all the way down toward the right side of the
picture.

<I>D226-323 09-06-19</I> - <B>We arrive at our campsite late ...</B><xxx>

<BR>(Here are some more of those yellow flowers.) By this time both
Derek and I are twice as tired as anybody else.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-325.jpeg">
<I>D226-325 09-06-19</I> - <B>... when the birds have all stopped singing.</B><xxx>

<BR>I don't know what bird this is. Angelo tells me but I don't have the energy
to write it down. I don't even know if birds can sing at this
altitude.

<BR>Hi Derek,
<BR>
<BR>I enjoyed your presentation. Pretty sure your photo was of a Giant
Hummingbird. I base that mainly on the large bill. It is a bird of the
high mountains and is the largest of all hummingbirds.

<BR>Don't those flowers suggest piercing by red-hot needles? They slightly
resembles the lipstick plant sold as a potted houseplant in Canada. However,
unlike the lipstick plant, this one doesn't have cute fuzzy petals with a
small club-like bend at the tip. Merle and I arrive at camp this evening so
late there's only a half-hour or so of daylight left to washup and pull
ourselves together. The others have checked in long ago. Dusk about 6:15pm.

<BR>Another hiking day and more ruins. Don't seem to be any modern villages in
sight at the moment, but no shortage of ancient remains. This area must have
been strategically important to the Incas.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-331.jpeg">
<I>D226-331 09-06-20</I> - <B>We trek past more Inca sites.</B><xxx>

<BR>The route down from Warmiwinuska Pass. The Inca Trail snakes down the right
hand side of the valley. The ruin, left, was probably a staging point, or
surveillance lookout. All messengers or commercial traffic on the trail would
have to pass within sight. The post appears to have a fair view of the pass
and could give ample warning of the approach of any group coming across.
<BR>

<I>D226-333 09-06-20</I> - <B>Memorials to departed hikers.</B><xxx>

<BR>We're not quite sure if these Inukshuk things are memorials to hikers who
didn't make it, or to hikers who <I>did</I> make it. In either case they're
probably not Inca in origin.

<BR>This time with enough surplus energy to skip up to the top of a
nearby hillock for a better view. That's Ian and Tim,

<BR>Cloud effects. We're on the same level as the clouds, so this provides a
radically different kind of view compared to what you'd see from the lower
valleys.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-340.jpeg">
<I>D226-340 09-06-20</I> - <B>Merle, loving it. Derek game, frazzled.</B><xxx>

<BR>Merle is unable to remove that grin from her face. You hear of that
affliction with scuba divers: rapture of the depths. This is rapture of the
heights and produces the ecstatic look that often comes over people who do
high altitude treking.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-347.jpeg">
<I>D226-347 09-06-20</I> - <B>Altar.</B><xxx>

<BR>This was the back wall, we're told, with an incised figure of a puma. I can't
visualize it, but the place still emanates some of the power it might have
had to the ancients. We walk round the ruin, full of corridors, unexpected
rooms, almost like a maze. The ambiance of the site, its mountain location,
might have helped to reinforce its sacred quality.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-348.jpeg">
<I>D226-348 09-06-20</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>A lower site with agricultural terraces.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-349.jpeg">
<I>D226-349 09-06-20</I> - <B>Possibly an attachment for a door post.</B><xxx>

<BR>It shows signs of being burnished by rope or fibres repeatedly

<I>D226-350 09-06-20</I> - <B>The site's environment.</B><xxx>

<BR>No sign of terracing on the mountainside. But the rich growth of vegetation
compared with the drier opposite side of the pass, suggests agricultural
possibilities down below.

<I>D226-354 09-06-20</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Agricultural terraces down below seen in telephoto view. Spaces for caretakers,
farmworkers, storage. One problem with farming in a steep "V"-shaped valley
like this. You may get direct sunlight for only a part of the day. But that
day, near the equator, has I believe, less seasonal variation in length than
in the temperate zones.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-355.jpeg">

<I>d230-167 09-06-20</I> - <B>Carole D: Our last lunch on the trail.</B><xxx>

<BR>The porters go to all the trouble of setting up a tent with tables and chairs
for lunch. Remember, this is not a fixed campsite with road access. Porter
people have had to carry all the equipment, cooking utensils and fuel, plus
the food itself, from our starting point.
<BR>

<I>D226-359 09-06-20</I> - <B>Flute player with another group.</B><xxx>

<BR>A startling thing. Flute music coming from down the trail. Moving along, we
find the guide of another group sitting in the shrubbery playing Inca
melodies. This really evokes ancient times and a totally different way of life.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-360.jpeg">
<I>D226-360 09-06-20</I> - <B>Trail goes through crack.</B><xxx>

<BR>Part of the original trail, not cut either by the Incas or the parks
department. This was a natural feature exploited by the creators of the
trail. Merle is stepping out onto a newer surface of skilfully laid
flagstones, very stable and free of obstruction.

<I>D226-370 09-06-20</I> - <B>Aguas Calientes, far below.</B><xxx>

<BR>In the lower distance, a town. Probably our eventual destination, Aguas
Calentes. A railway runs through it, and that looks a lot like a football
field in the middle, near where we're likely to find our hotel. In the valley
in back, are the hot springs that feed the baths we're destined to visit,
tomorrow. Isn't precognition great. Unavoidable when you write about the
past, but in the present tense.

<I>D226-379A 09-06-20</I> - <B>Atmospheric environment FX</B><xxx>

<BR>Here the details of foliage are reduced to Turner-esque glints
of sunlight on the leaves. The finer detail of the distant
mountains has been blended with a wet-on-wet process, but the
outlines are preserved even in the clouds. These have an
agressive quality that harmonizes with a kind of "hob-knobbing
with the elements" idea.
<BR> Real figures, iconic landscape. The original details of the figures have
been allowed to show through. The digital treatment can be a composite of
different effects. You can combine various steps of abstraction and
interpretation with the original image, and apply the result only to local
areas of that image. Thus, the clouds are softly blended within, but outlined
more clearly along the edges.

a couple of raindrops on the whole trip.

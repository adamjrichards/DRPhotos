<P>    It was shortly after dawn; water conditions were calm and
the brigade would probably reach the mouth of the Kaministiquia
River late that afternoon. From there, Fort William was only a
few minutes upstream. But a line of thickening overcast in the
west threatened, and if the wind veered round to bring in heavy
waves from the open lake, they might be forced to put ashore on
these palisaded coasts and wait out the blow. James was anxious
to press onward.
<P>    In the distance, Thunder Cape was taking shape in outline,
the last major landmark before crossing Thunder Bay and leaving
Lake Superior for good. At long last, they'd strike inland
toward Lake-of-the-Woods, through the final stretch of lake and
forest that stood between them and the western plains.
<P>    A heroic landscape, a fit playground for the gods of legend,
but James' own God didn't seem to fit.  Captain Ames' Bible lay
open on one knee while he tried to concentrate on study. He
leafed through a wilderness of "begats" and "thou shalt nots".
But his eyes kept returning to the landmarks of the coast,
ranging ahead to that misty point where water, land and sky met.
At each indentation of the shore, he prospected the terrain for
likely campsites. At each promontory, he imagined a climb up the
rocks to search the offing for signs and portents.
<P>    The removal of the pistol ball from Maidstone's shoulder had
given him stature in the eyes of the men. Behind the Captain's
back they had their own version of events. Ensign Fielding and
Maidstone had fought a duel over the lady. James had emerged
victorious, cuckolding a man nobody liked, winning an affair of
honour and then magnanimously patching up the bully. The poetic
justice of it was a thing of almost tearful beauty to this troop
of aging veterans.
<P>    What heightened the irony to near surrealistic levels was
Captain Ames' reaction to the affair. James was actually
assigned personal responsibility for the Maidstones. All thought
of "improprieties" was set aside. He was to keep a watch on the
injured man and see he was provided with every comfort that
might promote a quick recovery. Mrs. Maidstone was to be given
all feasible assistance in her sketching and, in the words of
the Captain, to be "entertained with cheerful conversation to
relieve her mind of gloom following her terrible ordeal."
<P>    The lady sat on the seat beside him, picking at the contents
of her reticule.  She would extract a scrap of linen and work at
the embroidery of some minute design. Then she would sigh deeply
and stuff it back in again, resuming contemplation of the
endless procession of wave crests. He'd treated her with the
utmost propriety since the accident, even with a certain
coolness. It was a double disobedience to his superior's orders,
he supposed. Previously, he'd behaved with unseemly warmth.
Now he displayed a severe rectitude that stifled cheerful
conversation.
<P>    Maidstone lay fitfully dozing on a pile of cargo packs
arranged in a row along the centre line of the canoe. James met
the convalescent's narrowed eyes from time to time, but received
no hint of thanks for his surgical prowess. For that matter, no
sign of rancour either.  He began to wonder if the incident put
him under some odd kind of obligation. His own life, he owed to
this man's fortunate injury, and to the shielding power of
several hundred pages of Holy Writ. The thing had the flavour of
a theological conundrum, but James found no satisfactory
solution in the phrases of the Bible. "Turn the other cheek. Go
the extra mile." That was pat advice for squabbling neighbours.
Among the predatory creatures of the frontier, one was forced to
take stronger measures.
<P>    Searching for inspirational messages, he turned a block of
pages stuck together in one piece. The books of Genesis, Exodus
and Leviticus, right through to Deuteronomy, were crimped
together by the depth of Maidstone's slash.  He shuddered; the
man had tried to inflict this very cut on <I>him</I>. Now, as he
leafed his way through to Joshua, the pages had to be peeled
apart with some care.
<P>    Explaining the Bible's damage had proven an exercise in
circumlocution. The amiable Captain had taken James' halting
story for a commendable reticence when he attempted to describe
grappling with the "intruder" who had threatened Mrs. Maidstone.
In point of fact, he'd merely stuffed the Bible in his trousers
when he'd gone to keep his tryst with the lady. To have
approached her, Scripture in hand, would have seemed silly
enough under the circumstances. But in addition, he'd expected
the volume would have the effect of restraining any embarrassing
physical manifestation of his desire for her.
<P>    He read listlessly on, then his eyes lit on a passage which
aroused intense interest. "And Joshua the son of Nun sent out
two men to spy secretly, saying ..." For a startled moment, he
almost expected to see the names Harris and Fielding on the
printed page. His mind began leaping from verse to verse,
recollecting his own recruitment to The Society for the
Diffusion of Geographical Knowledge.
<P>
<P>              ... Go view the land, even Jericho. They went, and came
          into the house of an harlot, named Rahab, and lodged there.
          And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
          the men that are come unto thee. And she took the two men,
          and hid them and she said unto them, I know that the Lord
          hath given you the land. Now therefore, I pray you, swear
          unto me by the Lord, since I have shewn you kindness, that
          ye will also shew kindness unto my father's house and
          deliver our lives from death.
<P>              And the men answered her, Our lives for yours, if you
          utter not this our business. Then she let them down by a
          cord through the window: for her house was upon the town
          wall. And the men said unto her, Behold, when we come into
          the land, thou shalt bind this line of scarlet thread in the
          window which thou didst let us down by. And whosoever shall
          be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head,
          if any hand be upon him.
<P>              So the two men returned, and came to Joshua the son of
          Nun, and they told him all things that befell them. And the
          Lord said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine hand
          Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of valour.
<P>              And it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of
          the trumpet, and they shouted with a great shout, that the
          wall fell down flat, and they utterly destroyed all that was
          in the city; but Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and
          her father's household, and all that she had, because she
          hid the messengers, which Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
<P>          
<P>    James sat absorbed, imagining far-fetched parallels to the
Bible story until a hand pressed his arm. He looked up with
guilty surprise into the face of ... not Rahab, but Mrs.
Maidstone. Tired of her embroidery, she wished he would dip her
a cup of cool water from over the side. She shaded her eyes in
the glaring light and smiled pleasantly from under the brim of
her bonnet.  The suggestion of tiny age lines at the corners of
her eyes caught his attention for the first time.  He handed her
the water. She sipped a moment, then held the tin cup toward his
own lips. He took it and regarded her across the cup's rim,
taking his time to consider her face. The smile lingered
briefly, then she turned to stare out over the empty surface of
the lake.
<P>    Maidstone, restless, shifted position, looking up for a
second before flinging his good arm over his eyes and composing
himself again to rest. James made an elaborate pretense of
examining his watch. The canoemen seemed excited by the nearness
of the destination. Their stroke had picked up to almost one a
second. He snapped the case shut and turned away from the lady,
making a weak attempt to resume his perusal of scripture.
<P>    She watched the horizon a long while, the edge of an ear and
a loose curl visible under her bonnet. He abandoned reading to
fasten on these details, watching the lock of hair flutter in
the wind above a suggestion of graceful neck. Such delicate
wisps, he thought, then checked himself. That precious neck
supported, among other delights, a pair of eyes that had sighted
down a pistol by the light of a rising moon -- at two men
fighting over <I>her</I>. All very romantic, and deadly. Those hands,
now serenely folded, had fired the shot that had struck his
assailant. But it was only by the slimmest piece of luck she
hadn't hit <I>him</I>. The hair on his arm had been scorched by that
shot, so close had he been to Maidstone, striving for his life
against the man whose own arm now lay immobilized in a sling.
<P>    In very fact, <I>she</I> was the "little disruption" that
Maidstone had promised Enright that night in the cabin of the
schooner <I>Progress</I>.
<P>    She turned to face him, her back to the breeze, windblown
hair blurring the outline of her face. Her eyes were damp as she
fumbled in her reticule. Coming up with the embroidery, she
snapped the last thread, removed the cloth from its stretcher
and proceeded to dab at her eyes with it.
<P>    "Is it the wind, madam? May I get you another cup of water?"
He was being coldly obedient to the Captain's order to be of
service.
<P>    She looked at him a moment, squinting from behind the
concealment of the handkerchief, then thrust it full in his
face. The frail linen clung to his brow for a second and blew
past his ear. With a convulsive movement he swatted and pinned
it to the gunwale just before it was swept overboard.
<P>    "It was for you," she said in a throaty tone, turning her
back again.
<P>    He held the dainty thing in his hand, stealing a glance at
the steersman who stood tall in the stern behind them. But the
man's eyes were seeking the turning round Thunder Cape. The
canoe men still maintained a steady sixty beats to the minute,
their thoughts far ahead of petty misunderstandings over cups of
water and embroidered handkerchiefs. He unfolded the scrap of
cloth and saw a tiny rose picked out in fine thread. Scarlet,
the token of Rahab. Or was it the crimson of a passionate heart?
<P>    He put it to his nostrils. It smelled just as enticing as
she had. A painful lump began to form in his throat. As he
stuffed the handkerchief in his coat pocket, he had a
premonition of parting from love itself, of eternal separation
from those wisps of hair that fluttered just behind her
earlobes.
<P>    "Will ... will you be remaining long in Fort William?" His
voice broke out in the silence between them as he tried to
repair the ravages of the past week. But it was too late. Her
tone had a steely edge he'd never heard before.
<P>    "Much depends on the improvement of Mr. Maidstone's
condition. For my part, I would as soon take passage east on the
next available schooner. ... Or then again," she seemed to be
making a special effort to sound willful, "I may decide to
travel with the inland brigades up the Saskatchewan. My original
plan was to depict the customs of the Plains Indians."
<P>    The sentimental lump in James' throat subsided as he
considered the actual possibility of this startling piece of
feminine initiative.
<P>    "But Madam, think of the dangers of a woman travelling
alone."
<P>    He didn't think very much about those risks for his own sake,
but then she had a way of claiming unusual attention, if not for
her alarming opinions, then for her appearance. It was
difficult to imagine a woman this attractive, able to travel
alone without serious risk.
<P>    "Your concern for womankind is most touching." Her voice was
low but she put hard irony into the words. "D'you think -- in
purely abstract terms mind you -- that a woman's fears of
travelling alone should be any greater than of going about with
an unpredictable escort of armed ruffians? And in the particular
case, would she face a more fearsome prospect than being -- on
alternate days of the week -- ignored and abused by a misguided
political visionary? Or, on weekends, patronised ad nauseam by a
nautical Sunday school teacher. Or, and here we hit the mark,
would the hazards of travel, unencumbered by companions, be any
more daunting to one who bestows her ultimate favour on an eager
lover, who later gives every sign of coldly repudiating her
companionship?"
<P>    Her incandescent gaze swept round the fleet of canoes,
singeing with her eyes at least one specimen of each class of
humanity, last of all burning a hole in James. The marvellous
spectacle of Thunder Cape, looming above them, passed unnoticed.
<P>    James tried to answer in his own low, measured tones. He
hoped she wouldn't inform the whole brigade of her strong
opinions. And that she might reconsider the events of the last
weeks in a different light. But he knew the agility of her mind
and shrank back from championing the merits of rakish young army
officers, doddering sea-captains and misguided political
visionaries. Better to confine himself to some less vulnerable
position. Defence of social propriety, for instance.
<P>    "Madam, the only members of your sex in the entire Northwest
are the common women of the Indians and the fur traders. And,
... and the good wives of a few settlers in the Red River country.
Who would keep a lady company? Who would shelter her from harm?"
<P>    Perhaps it was because she was a lady who had been, for his
sake, <I>not</I> a lady -- just another <I>common</I>, man-trusting woman
-- that he had a sudden guilty feeling of having badly mischosen
his words, of having insulted both her and women in general. But
he was unable to imagine how to apologize, or exactly what sin
to apologize for.
<P>    Her voice was a double distillation of fury and
disappointment and she spat out the words: "Who, <I>indeed</I>, would
shelter her, Mr Fielding? Perhaps someone who owes the only
member of his <I>own</I> sex, to a common woman."
<P>    A brief, embarrassed silence while he considered the
startling implications of this final riposte. So, her pistol shot
had been no accident. Now, even more bemused, he attempted to
change the subject.
<P>    "... Yes, well, I imagine the expedition will set out for
the Red River as soon as preparations can be completed at Fort
William. And that will mean goodbye. ..."
<P>    James' fund of conversation in the last few days had
dwindled severely. He'd dared venture only such useless truisms
as might be vouchsafed any ordinary member of the public. Now he
was completely bankrupt. The lady didn't offer to draw him out
any further.
<P>
<P>    Nearing the western shore of Thunder Bay, signs of commerce
marked the terminus of lake travel in British North America. 
Here and there, local craft could now be seen, even a few small
sail.  They approached the mainland past the Welcome Islands and
entered the mouth of the Kaministiquia River to see the fort up
ahead on the right hand. At the long-awaited sight of their
destination, the canoemen broke out in cheers and war-whoops,
redoubling efforts to be the first alongside the quay.  From the
gates of the fort and the encampments on either side, people
hurried along the shore to the boat landing. As the canoes
pulled closer, the uproar became general. They were cheered
onward as much by their own shouts as by the noise of the
crowds. Creamy bow waves foamed and they surged forward at a
speed that would have seemed unimaginable the previous week.
<P>    At the landing stage, canoemen and passengers tumbled onto
dry land in a frenzy of back-slapping and hand-shaking. Captain
Ames' canoe came alongside and the white-headed figure, smiling
broadly, wove his way through the crowd to James' side.
<P>    "A pretty fair passage, Fielding, despite our few minor
delays. I must see the factor immediately and make arrangements
to forward equipment and supplies to the interior. D'you see
that cloudbank to the south-west? Rain, if I'm not mistaken.
Take charge of unloading. See that all the equipment's stowed
high and dry." The Captain turned to view the quayside bustle. 
"Oh, and do offer to assist Mr. Maidstone and his wife, should
they require any more help."
<P>    "Yes, sir. And I'll see the instruments are moved to
shelter, immediately, sir."
<P>    "Excellent, Fielding, first class." The Captain gave a nod
that said "trusted lieutenant" and bustled off toward the fort.
<P>    "Crocker!" James gave a bellow that could be heard above the
din. "Looks like rain, Sergeant. See to the stacking and
covering of these stores. Don't forget the Captain's personal
things. And do try to keep those ravenous troopers of yours
under control. The Chief's gone into the fort to arrange for
supper. I expect we'll be having a little celebration for
getting here in one piece."
<P>    James received a salute and the Sergeant's familiar grin in
response. Then he put his thumb in his waistband and turned to
stare magisterially out over the bay they'd just crossed.
<P>    The advantage of being a "trusted lieutenant" was that -- as
your part of the bargain with the old man -- you got to rely on
your own trusty retainer to "see to" things. The trouble was,
James knew he had become a little too skilful lately in
buttering up his superior. A man he knew had been appointed so
the expedition would fail. Was he reinforcing authority for the
good of the project, or simply to make his own life more
comfortable?
<P>    Across the water, a few straggling canoes were still heading
for the fort. With luck they'd be alongside before the squall
hit. Odd thing, now that he had a moment to look back, his own
life seemed to be a lot like that -- always arriving in port in
the nick of time.
<P>    He knew one thing at least. He might be a raw recruit, but
he was now accepted by the Captain and the men as a serious
contender for leadership. He had one foot in the door and that
was something.
<P>    Satisfied on the subject of the stores and the weather,
James finally remembered the Maidstones. Locating them in the
diminishing crowd, he noted that Mr. Maidstone was sufficiently
recovered to offer his good arm to his wife. Together they were
disappearing in the direction of the fort's main gate, behind a
canoeman carrying luggage. Another problem off the agenda. With
a sense of relief, he turned to Harris, who was checking
scientific instruments against a list.
<P>    "Harris, d'you think the walls of Fort William would come
tumbling down if Crocker marched the men round and round and
gave a mighty shout?"
<P>    Harris was rarely taken aback by a peculiar turn of thought.
He treated this remark just like ordinary conversation.
<P>    "Not unless his name is Sergeant <I>Joshua</I> Crocker. And you
and I happen to be Israelite spies. Are you? No? I thought so.
Now, do help me check this list. Our astronomical telescope
appears to be missing -- temporarily, let us hope."
<P>    For a person who took in every detail, Harris was remarkably
free from the limitations of a pedestrian mind. So was Mrs.
Maidstone. But after weeks of close contact with that exhausting
woman, it was a relief to turn to someone who regarded cryptic
speech as merely another innocent pastime.

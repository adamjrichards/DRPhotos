<P>    The rapids of the St. Lawrence gave the Fieldings a tumultuous
welcome to the town of Montreal. Preparations for James'
induction into the army were soon put in motion by his father. Then,
after a brief interview with Major Snell, an old comrade-in-arms
of Captain Fielding, they were soon underway once again. Life
was unfolding at a dizzying pace.
<P>    The Governor's summer establishment consisted of a large,
two-storey stone house looking out over its lawns toward the
Quebec road. Beyond, an expanse of meadow and the St. Lawrence
River. Hedgerows ran down to the water through fields on either
hand. In back, extensive outbuildings and neat plantations of
orchard suggested that some earlier tenant had taken a keen
interest in agriculture. As they cantered into the yard, a groom
dashed out of the stable to take the horses. 
<P>    "Captain Fielding, sir," said the sergeant who had
accompanied them from Montreal, "I'll just make meself
comfortable out here in back till you're ready to leave again.
... If you don't mind, sir?" Without waiting for an answer, the
man was already making a beeline for the kitchen door. James
also felt a pang of hunger as well as twinges of an even more
basic sort.
<P>    The Fieldings were left to follow the verandah to the front
entrance. A few tentative raps with the ornate knocker brought a
reply and they were ushered in by a servant.  This grave-looking
retainer took names and business and promptly retired through a
set of double doors leaving them standing in the hallway.  He
had a way of swinging the portals ceremoniously wide with a
spreading flourish of both hands, entering the room and turning
about. Then he pressed the doors shut again with a smooth,
bowing motion. Presently he reappeared, reversing his elegant
procedure and announced, "Major Dall will see you directly,
gentlemen.  Pray be seated." They were ushered into a sitting
room containing a writing desk, several cupboards of books and
sporting prints on the walls. 
<P>    They waited in silence, James craning his neck to read the
titles of the books. The senior Fielding was just wondering
aloud what had become of the brandy and cigars they'd been
assured of by Major Snell. Then the door burst open and a very
young and good-looking Major flounced breathless into the
room. 
<P>    "Ah, jolly old Captain Fieldpiece. Don't get up. I understand
you bring news from Kingston? What is it this time? Have you run
over on your construction estimates for Fort Henry again?"
<P>    The Captain cleared his throat. "We have laid hands on
certain information, Major Dall. The authorities at Kingston
have decided it should be evaluated at the highest level. ...
And I concur, sir, if I may say so.  So if you would convey my
respects, I should be most obliged." 
<P>    "You have 'laid your hands on'? You 'concur'? 'Certain
information' is it?" Major Dall had a way placing emphasis as if
the words conveyed some impression offensive to a squeamish
sensibility. An unfortunate choice of language, perhaps. "This
is all <I>most</I> peculiar." He lowered his smooth posterior very
slowly to a chair and stared at them in mock expectation.
<P>    The Major appeared to want additional corroboration from the
two supplicants, unimpeachable evidence that the matter deserved
more than a few seconds of his precious attention. The eyebrows
hovered above a pair of eyes open just a shade wider than
normal. Not so naively wide, however, as to express candid
interest. A lock of hair threatened to stray onto his handsome
forehead. James wondered if <I>he</I> would ever achieve that same
look of impeccable negligence. With matters at a silent impasse,
the Major made a slight sideways movement of his head. An
instant later, he arched his brows minutely higher, still
keeping the elder Fielding fixed with the same insolent stare.
<P>    "The news concerns American designs in the Northwest, Major
Dall. The circumstances by which this intelligence came into our
hands are so irregular ... that His Excellency may well desire
to supplement the written report by posing questions to the very
individual who was most instrumental in the discovery."
<P>    Here, Fielding adjusted his grip on the leather case
containing the report. He nodded toward James. Finally, he
tucked the case firmly under his arm and shifted forward as if
to underline his request that they be ushered into the presence
of Major Dall's august superiors without further ado. 
<P>    The Major's eyebrows plunged. He frowned, then cast a
significant glance at James. "Oh, have it your own way,
Fielding." He stood up languidly, adjusting his cuffs. "The
Governor and his staff have completed their repast. They are no
doubt in a mood to receive the troops. Or would you care to ...
(here the Major gave a discreet sniff) freshen up a little
before going in?" 
<P>    "Thank you, Major. I would prefer to go in as soon as
convenient."
<P>    As they trailed in, all heads turned and conversation
hushed. Before Major Dall could make introductions, the Governor
himself stepped forward. Fussily dressed in the style of an
earlier decade, he was a portly individual with choleric
complexion, narrow-set eyes and a brow that seemed knotted in a
perpetual frown. Abruptly, the frown unknotted and he extended
one chubby paw in greeting while patting the Captain's shoulder
with the other. 
<P>    "George Fielding, what brings you from Kingston? Not
trouble, I hope? And who, pray tell, is this young lad skulking
along behind you?" The ferocious frown re-knotted the
gubernatorial brow. 
<P>    "My son, James, Your Excellency. I trust he may be able to
expand upon the matter of our visit."
<P>    "Yes, yes, do let's get on with it." The Governor rubbed his
hands in anticipation of a juicy piece of news.
<P>    "The dispatch is addressed ... ah, to you, sir." Fielding
glanced toward the ranking general officer, uncertain how to
keep the channels of official communication properly sorted out.
<P>    "Yes, do interpret it for us, Archie, there's a good
fellow." The Governor smirked and muttered an aside to Fielding.
"In Montreal we earn our keep opening envelopes and breaking
seals." Then, sotto voce: "Or perhaps, opening bottles and
breaking wind."
<P>    The General stepped forward from a group clustered at the
fireplace, put on an impervious face and took the packet from
Fielding. He dealt with the seal and perused the contents. The
hum of conversation resumed as the company speculated idly or
returned to earlier topics. 
<P>    "Brandy for Captain Fielding, and someone ..." The Governor
craned his neck for a handy flunky. "Ah, you, Dall, be a good
chap and take the lad out and find him some pigeon pie. Yes,
<I>you</I>, sir." The beady eyes of the Governor pursued Major Dall,
who fastened on James and led him away.
<P>
<P>    Outside the drawing room, James ventured an urgent request.
"Excuse me, sir, but could you tell me ...? I mean to say, we
<I>have</I> been riding most of the afternoon and ..." The Major
turned with a condescending look that made him acutely aware of
the inferior status conferred by youth, a colonial accent and a
full bladder. 
<P>    "The stable is out <I>that</I> way." Major Dall nodded toward a
corridor leading to the rear of the house. "And do remember to
wipe your boots before coming back inside." He indicated a
serving pantry adjacent to the dining room, then marched off
to find a servant who could supply the pigeon pie that His
Excellency had prescribed. 
<P>    When James got back, a serving girl had laid a place for
him. She was just now setting out a portion of pie. A lamp had
been lit on the table in anticipation of dusk. Pouring out a
draft of ale, she looked in his direction from the corner of her
eye. His own eye met hers. She held the pitcher in mid-air a
second too long, then placed it, with infinite grace, on the
table. 
<P>    "Bonsoir, mademoiselle."
<P>    Putting her head sweetly down, she murmured, "Bonsoir,
m'sieu'." Then she picked up the ale pitcher again, cradled it
lovingly against her breast and moved it to the sideboard in a
graceful but quite unnecessary sweep of bare arms.
<P>    She scurried away down the corridor. One sidelong glance
pierced James as he was raising a piece of pigeon pie to
half-open lips. What towers of imagination are constructed on
the foundation of a sidelong glance. He ate his pie in a
reverie. Outside the window, the sun lay on the horizon,
partially obscured by a hedgerow of elm trees. Looking across
the roadway and up the river, he could see a small boat making
its way toward the setting sun. A canoe perhaps, but difficult
to tell at this distance. 
<P>    As the sky darkened, the light of the lamp picked out the
near objects in the room. A framed engraving on the wall caught
his attention. It was a scene from a book he'd seen in his
father's library. A cathedral spire rose in the background, and
closer up, a barge in a canal lock, over-arched by a bridge made
of iron. On the parapet, two gentlemen lounged, contemplating
the prospect before them. James, who had lived every day of his
life, surrounded by wilderness pine trees and the stony pastures
of Kingston, noted the peculiar "familiarity" of a scene he had
never witnessed.
<P>    So many solid English virtues summed up in a picture.
Religion, modern enterprise, comfortable manors nestling in a
well-manicured country-side. To James, a sense of home. He
associated that scene with a set of books shelved beside his
father's favourite chair in the parlour. As a young lad during
the war, he would sit on a stool alongside and pore over the
pictures while his father consulted maps and designs of
fortifications. And when Fielding senior spoke of home, of
England, he'd be sitting in that very seat of wisdom as he told
of life in the Old Country.
<P>    James looked up at a flicker of light outside the window.
The last gleams of day lit the bosom of the broad St. Lawrence,
flooding seaward from the heart of the New World. 
<P>
<P>    Major Dall strutted back into the room as James was
finishing his pie and ale. "Ah, Fielding, I see you've satisfied
your basic requirements -- for the moment, at least. Never far
below the surface are they? By the way, what do you colonials do
for excitement down in Kingston? Besides building fabulously
expensive fortifications." 
<P>    Revived by the meal, James took the Major's familiarity at
face value. He launched into a catalogue of schoolboy activities
that began with sailing small boats about the harbour and islands,
progressed through experiments in the local manufacture of
gunpowder, and ended with interesting remarks about his visits
to remote Indian encampments. Noting with gratification the
steadily increasing arch of the Major's eyebrows, he fully
expected his listener to be impressed.
<P>    "You mean to say there are no horse races, no wagers, no
women in your poor, benighted life?" 
<P>    James took this remark as the usual racy, insulting humour
affected by all bluff regimental types. He smiled engagingly
back at the Major, chattering on about his hope of joining a
British regiment and participating in the many challenges of
military life on the frontier. 
<P>    "Oh, do shut up a moment, will you? There's a stout little
chap."
<P>    A chill came over James. Was the Major about to inform him of
some unfortunate change of plans? He glanced furtively into the
corridor, hunting for some clue as to what had diverted his
listener's attention. But Dall's eyes didn't leave his own. 
<P>    "You really <I>are</I> a sight for sore eyes. Gadding about the
woods playing at Red Indians. This is the <I>British</I> army, not
the Yankee militia."
<P>    A fleck of spittle lit on James' face from the furious
emphasis of the word "British". Major Dall continued with
exaggerated clarity as if addressing a dull-witted foreigner.
<P>    "Why don't you colonials stick to lugging furs? Confine your
leisure hours to knocking up the local women?"  He clapped James
on the back. "Wait, I have it.  We'll find you a position in the
Indian Department. And to make it quite respectable, we'll give
you a scarlet coat. Make you some sort of a Captain just like
your Daddy. How'd that be?"
<P>    Dall's face leered close in the lamplight. The bluff humour
palled and James felt a surge of fierce anger. Contempt like
this could only be met by force. No <I>words</I> could make this
uniformed ape keep a civil tongue. He erupted out of his chair,
jarring the table so the lamp teetered. Dall jumped back with a
look of alarm.
<P>    Just in time, a buzz from the closed doors of the drawing
room captured their attention. "Where the blazes have Dall and
young Fielding got to?" sang out an imperious voice. The
Governor flung wide the doors. "Ah, there you are my boy. You
simply <I>must</I> give us your impressions of the Yankee Colonel." 
<P>    "Excuse me, Major. I think, we're wanted in the neighbouring
room." James fairly croaked out the words, at the same time
mightily relieved he'd not attempted to lower those perpetually
raised eyebrows.
<P>    "I hereby command you to tell the tale, <I>forthwith</I> ...
Anything the matter, my boy?" The Governor knotted his eyebrows
in defiance of any threat that might prevent his hearing the
story of the day, direct from the young hero's own lips.
<P>    "Not really, sir." Surrounded by a ring of interested faces,
James recovered composure in the brightly lit room. "What can I
tell you about?" 
<P>    "You can begin ... Where <I>is</I> that servant?" The Governor
scanned the room with aquiline eye. "Major Dall, into the
breach. Bustle and get someone to fetch the lad more ale. No!
fetch <I>Ensign</I> Fielding some brandy. Be quick about it. He needs
fortification. Haw, haw, fortification, Fielding, d'you see?"
Here he nudged the Captain and shivered with enjoyment at his
own excellent good humour.
<P>    "Fortification? ... ehaw. Vewy good, Y'Excellency. The best
bwandy for young Fielding, by all means," murmured an
exquisitely turned-out officer in the circle closest round the
Governor.
<P>    "Tell us ... tell us the bit about Colonel Enright taking
you to breakfast after you laid siege to his writing desk in
Sackets Harbor." The Governor was already convulsed with mirth,
apparently primed in advance by the elder Fielding.
<P>    James put on a pale smile, hoping the chuckles of the
Governor meant his escapade was now quite forgiven. But he had
nothing to fear. What was sabotage to an American, was
buffoonery to a genteel Englishman, especially one surrounded by
an admiring staff. 
<P>    "Yes, sir. ... Well, we were pretty busy stuffing things
into a knapsack, then we heard a key in the lock and both of us
jumped a foot. My brother Paul escaped out the same gunport we
used to get into the blockhouse in the first place. I'd just
tossed him the papers we'd collected when the Colonel's Aide
caught me by the seat of the pants. ('Pity', said an
ironical-sounding voice in back. It sounded a lot like Major
Dall.) ... Er, meanwhile, the Colonel was busy putting out the
fire we accidentally started when our candle upset. The blaze
was in an old writing desk the Colonel must have been using for
his private letters. Pretty smokey for a while.
<P>    "After things settled down, they hauled me into town. A
crowd had gathered. At first they couldn't see I was tied up.
The Colonel made sarcastic remarks about me being a British
recruit to his staff. (Murmurs from the assembled company:
'highly improper', etc.) Then they put me in the lockup for the
rest of the day and that night. (Groans, 'the rotter', etc.)
<P>    "Next morning they dragged me out again and the Colonel took
me to breakfast at a big hotel down the street. He asked the
innkeeper to bring him a carving knife. I thought my time had
come when he upped and flung it right past my head. Stuck in the
wall not six inches from my ear. To throw a scare into me, I
suppose. (Jeers, 'impossible'.) Said he was going out west and
asked me if I knew anything about knife fighting. I told him my
favourite sport was cricket. (Cheers.) Then he gave me
breakfast. (Polite applause, 'rather decent, after all', etc.)
And when Colonel Enright finished the meal, he ..." 
<P>    "Out with it, lad."
<P>    "... he put out his tongue and licked the plate clean. Very
thoroughly, too."
<P>    Following this revelation, incredulous silence. Everyone
turned to James for confirmation. A grunting noise emanated from
the Governor who became even redder than usual. He was now
reduced to blowing his nose into his handkerchief. The incident
had not seemed comic to James at the time. But even he -- who'd
been warned by his mother against similar offences at table --
began to see how bizarre the story must seem in this very
proper, very upper-class, drawing room.
<P>    Sensing triumph, he continued. "And then Colonel Enright had
a quarrel with the innkeeper over when the Congress would send
him funds to pay the breakfast bill." At this, the entire
company burst into laughter. The Governor even spilled brandy on
the carpet. 
<P>    James felt for the first time in his life the dangerous
thrill of associating with very superior players indeed. Of
being the latest sensation in a group that would ignore him to
death in an instant, if he showed the slightest decline in
topicality. He'd just exploited that moment to the full. Now he
wasn't sure if he felt exhilarated by the sense of power this
room contained. Or if he was merely terrified at getting into
waters too deep and fast for his minnow's ability to swim
upstream.

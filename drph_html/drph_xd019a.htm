<P>Heading to Waterton
<P>
<P>Cruise on Waterton Lake
<P>
<P>From the Waterton waterfront
<P>The path to crypt Lake begins here. You reach it by a ferry trip from
Waterton.
<P>Looking north, back toward Canada from the U.S. end of the lake. Our cruise
boat, the International, was built near this site by U.S. railroad interests.
<P>Mt. Cameron shoulder on the left, U.S. side. They were named
after boundary surveyors.
<P>This cutline marks the Canada-U.S. border.
<P>
<P>Back at Waterton
<P>
<P>Seen from the Waterton waterfront.
<P>Local terrain almost guarantees strong southerly winds. This
lake is in a deep valley, enclosed by high, cool mountains on
the south, and  open to the hot, dry prairies on the north.

<P>    A torrent of peevish words burst on their ears as the
sticking door was battered ajar. 
<P>    "... Now who the blazes coulda left that rope hanging down?"
<P>    "Like I told ya, Colonel, it's prob'ly the work of some
sonofabitch militiaman. They's been stealin' whatever they can
lay hands on before they high-tails it home," came the disgusted
answer. "... Say, you think that tavern-keeper was tryin' ta get
rid of us?"
<P>    "Naw, Cyrus, he just figgered we needed a little stroll at
5 a.m. to sober us up."
<P>    Cramming the last fistfuls of papers into the saddle bags,
the two trespassers fled to the gun room upstairs. The
proprietors of the building finally heaved the door wide open
and tramped down the aisle of packing cases. 
<P>    The footsteps halted abruptly. "D'you smell smoke?
Something's <I>burning</I> ... over there behind the partition." The
voice of the one referred to as the Colonel rose in disbelief.
"Why, there's a FIRE in my old writing desk. How the hell ...?"
<P>    Sparks flew up as the two men flapped a piece of canvas over
the flames. They soon beat out the blaze that was consuming the
U.S. Army's commissariat records for the Sackets Harbor region.
The Colonel finally stamped on the last glowing ember, seeming
more astonished than angry.
<P>    "Now that's pretty damn peculiar, Cyrus. I was in here just
yesterday going through my baggage. Looking for some old letters
as a matter of fact. I was gonna give 'em hell down in
Washington."
<P>    "Shore was a near thing, Colonel. We better drag that desk
outside. Mebbe a few more sparks ..." They paused at a creak of
the floorboards overhead. Cyrus whirled round. "Well, I'll be!
The door to the gun room's open." He dashed for the stairs,
leaving the Colonel to ponder the ashes of his correspondence. 
<P>    At that same moment, James was unhooking Paul's trousers
from a nail in the sill of the gun port. As the rope went limp,
his confederate clumped to the ground. He tossed down the saddle
bags, then called out the window in a low voice. "Look out
below, I'm coming down ..." 
<P>    "NOT," bellowed a voice at his buttocks, "till you've said
howdy to the Colonel." A firm hand latched onto his belt and
yanked him backwards before he could jump. "Now lessee what we
got here," sneered his captor. James was frog-marched three at a
time down the stairs into the lower storey of the blockhouse. 
<P>    The Colonel held up the lantern in the smoke-filled room.
"Haul him outside so's we can get a better look at him. I've got
a feeling I've seen that face somewhere before." Cyrus wrenched
James' arm up behind his back while they felt their way through
the choking gloom to the entrance. 
<P>    "Here, get a good grip on him, sir. I'll jes' take a quick
look-see out back." Brandishing a sabre, Cyrus dashed round the
corner of the blockhouse. A moment later, he reappeared with the
incriminating grappling iron and rope. "No sign of nobody else.
Here, lemme tie up the young rapscallion." With a slash of his
blade, he severed the tarry hemp from the grappling iron. Then,
with the efficiency of a man who has in his time secured many a
prisoner, he bound James' hands behind his back.
<P>    "Name's Enright," said the Colonel. "Who the hell are <I>you</I>?
... Cyrus, hold that lantern up close so's I can see his face
better." James withered visibly in the glare. "Hell, you don't
look like any of my men. But you do seem kinda familiar."
<P>    James struggled to recall what he'd read about the treatment
of guerilla soldiers taken behind enemy lines. Capture was a
contingency he and Paul had not considered in detail. They'd
neglected to concoct any really coherent story to explain their
presence. He looked up wild-eyed. This must be the formidable
Colonel Chauncey Enright he'd heard so many fabulous tales
about. Some lucky prompting told him to be factual but
uncommunicative. 
<P>    "James Fielding, sir, of Kingston."
<P>    At the mention of Kingston, the Colonel seemed
thunderstruck. "Kingston, you say?" He rubbed a stubbly jaw.
"What in blazes you doing over this side of the river? Ain't you
got enough elbow-room for thievery over on your own side?" James
kept silent, hoping for an inspiration. 
<P>    "... Mebbe ... mebbe," offered Cyrus, eyes twinkling at the
Colonel, "the British don't know whether they's comin' <I>or</I>
goin'. Hell, last time I see'd 'em, they was <I>goin</I>'. An' right
smartly too, I reckon." He looked up admiringly at his taller
superior for signs the humour was appreciated. 
<P>    The sarcasm had its effect on James who had now calmed down
enough to see the need for a plausible excuse. Taking a cue from
his interrogators, he continued on the same tack as Cyrus.
<P>    "I'm <I>really</I> sorry for starting the fire, sir. You see, we
were sailing to pick up a cargo in Oswego. Then we lost our way
in the dark and decided to put in to shore. We merely came
inland to get our bearings."
<P>    "Fair enough. But why'd you break into my blockhouse? You
could've found out what you wanted simply by going into town."
<P>    "... Looking for a quiet place to spend the night." The
reply came out sounding more like a question. 
<P>    "Don't make no sense," said Cyrus. "Would've been a sight
easier to stay on yer boat."
<P>    "Shelter from the mosquitoes?" James was becoming more and
more uneasy at the uncontrolled leaps in his own explanations. 
<P>    "And how many others was with you?" demanded the
Colonel.
<P>    "Only myself and one crewman, sir. In fact, we'd just
decided to return to our boat when you entered the blockhouse."
<P>    He hoped Paul would have the sense to discard the saddle
bags with their incriminating load of papers. Damn! His brother
had no inkling about any trip to Oswego. But he might at least
have the sense to pretend ignorance of the whole incident. James
made a firm resolve. When he got out of this scrape, he would
surely compile a whole glossary of plausible excuses, well in
advance of any future escapade.
<P>    Cyrus' beady eyes narrowed. "My guess is, he's tellin' the
truth 'bout comin' over here from Kingston. I figger, the way we
been losin' stores, they's prob'ly a hull gang of 'em." The
Colonel showed his teeth in a sceptical grin. "Shore, Colonel,
they's cartin' off U.S. Army stores hullsale. Tradin' with the
likes o' this'n. Why, they's folks here in this town who'd sell
the shirt right off ..."
<P>    "Y'know, Cyrus, that's not a half bad idea. Maybe we'd be
better off selling our shirts to the British before they rot on
our backs. Maybe that'd help solve the Government's budget
problems." To mollify the shocked looks of his assistant, he
conceded, "C'mon Cyrus, don't take me so serious. We ain't at
war with the British no more." 
<P>    James was reassured that Colonel Enright was aware of this
fact. He recalled tales of drumhead justice meted out to spies
and irregulars caught operating in enemy territory without the
uniforms of regular soldiers. But the two Americans seemed
fascinated enough by the oddity of the incident to ignore the
prisoner himself as a source of further information. 
<P>    The Colonel and his aide made a brief inspection of the
blockhouse for lingering combustion. With James safely tied up,
they removed the writing desk and its load of charred paper.
Then the building was closed up as before. 
<P>    "Soon's we get back to town, Cyrus, put a sentry on this
blockhouse. And sometime this morning, take a few men and
straighten the place out. See I get a full report by noon. Don't
underplay the damage, got it?"  Under his breath he added, "And
maybe this'll give me some ammunition to use against Washington.
We'll either put this place back in trim, or we'll write it off,
lock, stock and barrel." He chuckled to himself and turned to
James. "Nothing like a little bonfire to clean out a mess of
unpaid bills, young fella." 
<P>    They made their departure with the sun already peeping over
the palisade. As they passed through the massive gateway behind
the blockhouse, James' mouth dropped open. The entrance was
revealed as gaping wide. All their acrobatics getting over the
palisade with rope and grappling iron had been futile.
<P>    "This place is worthless already, sonny. We can't shift
those timbers back into place with anything less than a regiment
of engineers. Ironwork is seized tight. Fact is, everything
around here is either rusted or rotted."
<P>    The Colonel seemed almost cheerful. Eager to gossip about
the problems of a decrepit peacetime command in the remoter
depths of New York State. 
<P>    As they strolled into town he began again, sounding relaxed
and casual. "So you're from over Kingston way, that right? I'm
told they're still doin' a mite o' buildin' over there these
days." 
<P>    James was relieved that Enright seemed to be in a mellow
mood. "Why, yes, sir, the, er ... fortification work is
proceeding." He didn't want to turn aside the olive branch the
Colonel was offering. But he decided against volunteering any
information on the newly-launched <I>Lawrence</I>, a monster ship of
112 guns, swinging at anchor in the harbour and ready to sail
against the Americans on short notice. Enright was probably not
such a bad fellow. Perhaps the whole incident might yet be
treated as a harmless prank.
<P>    "How come you fellas still need so much fortifying? We've
both signed the peace treaty. Don't you trust us? Or maybe
you're figuring to come on over here when my back is turned.
Take the ginger out of me once and for all?"  The Colonel's face
was all smiles.
<P>    "No, sir, the works you refer to are fixed emplacements.
They're intended only to defend communication between Upper and
Lower Canada."  Was he confiding too much or merely reiterating
what was common knowledge? 
<P>    "Well, I suppose it don't matter a hell of a lot. We'll all
be someplace else by next year. Right Cyrus? By the way, how's
the Captain doing?"
<P>    Something leapt from its hiding place in a corner of James'
mind. Something small and defenceless, scurrying in terror
across an open field. For a panic-stricken moment he could think
of no "Captain" but his own father.  He'd claimed to be headed
for Oswego to pick up a cargo. What "Captain" would a coastwise
trader be expected to know?  The harbourmaster of Kingston? Some
renowned fellow mariner? 
<P>    "Captain Fielding, your Daddy. Didn't they used to call him
'Old Fieldpiece'? Something to do with a cannon he once
mislaid."
<P>    The Colonel smiled steadily at James, still maintaining the
same air of easy camaraderie. But James was speechless, startled
by this unexpected penetration of his identity. No one who knew
of "Old Fieldpiece" would allow a Kingston Fielding to claim
he'd never heard of that particular member of the clan. 
<P>    His wits slowly regrouped. Perhaps the game wasn't quite up.
Better not to let on. The effect of the revelation might only be
to disclose his identity as "Young Fieldpiece". He swallowed
with a dry throat, but answered calmly.
<P>    "Very well indeed, sir. He keeps busy enough at his duties."
<P>    "And what's he think of your new career?" It was becoming
increasingly difficult to parry questions whose implications
were impossible to foresee. 
<P>    "My career, sir? But I've just completed my schooling in
Kingston ..." 
<P>    The Colonel interrupted. "No, I meant, what's he think of
your career in commerce?" 
<P>    An inexplicable question. James was more mystified than
ever. "But sir, I've nothing to do with trade. My father is
convinced I should go into the Army." 
<P>    At this, the Colonel put on his blandest smile, including
both James and his assistant Cyrus in its wide embrace. It was
the grin of a hoot-owl about to swoop on a succulent mouse. A
mouse that was now too far from its hiding place to escape the
grasping talons. 
<P>    "Well then, I reckon your little yarn about being on a
trading voyage musta been a lotta hogwash. You claimed you were
sailing to Oswego to pick up a cargo, remember? You put in here
to get your bearings. Take shelter from the mosquitoes." 
<P>    James had just missed his footing, gone hurtling from his
high perch into the depths. Something within him expired with a
long sinking moan. But surely one tiny misstep didn't merit
utter defeat. The Colonel's ruthless questioning was unjust.
Life shoudn't be like this. The adult generation was fanatical,
relentless, cruel.  Also stupid and humourless behind the facade
of responsibility. He wanted no part of growing up.
<P>    The prisoner clenched his teeth and retreated into a mood of
sullen quiet. He knew he'd just been trapped into a tacit
admission of guilt. The Colonel nodded sagely and stroked his
stubbly chin. The man was playing the game in earnest and James
had lost the final throw. Now he had to face the utter
nullification of all his half-baked schemes. His desire to
avenge the family honour, to tweak the Eagle's tail and attain
at least a small victory where his father's generation had
failed. Even the modest goal of obtaining useful military
intelligence had collapsed, bogged down somewhere in the mud
with Paul on the outskirts of Sackets Harbor.
<P>    "Can't let you British spy out our defenses just for sport,
y'know. Even if they <I>are</I> falling into wrack and ruin." The
Colonel leered at James, winked at Cyrus, and gave a few snorts.
These might have been interpreted as convivial laughter under
less trying circumstances. "Yup, more'n likely, it'll go pretty
hard with you, boy."
<P>    They passed through the streets of Sackets Harbor in the
awakening morning. The mists had risen and the bracing cool of
evening gave way to a humid warmth. The cloak of night, under
which any conspiracy might be hatched, was now replaced by the
sober light of day. Under its glare, every impulsive action had
its consequence. Glimpses of Lake Ontario showed between the
buildings and James fervently wished he was out on that lake,
sailing with Paul back to Kingston.
<P>     At length his futile yearning for freedom gave way to sober
calculation. He began to wonder what had actually happened to
Paul. For all he knew, his brother could be thrashing about in
the bush somewhere on the other side of the fort. He might still
be looking for the road back to the creek where they'd hidden
the boat. 
<P>    Passing the town's main hotel, they encountered a group of
early birds. These turned their attention to Colonel Enright's
young companion.
<P>    "Who you got there Colonel, a new recruit?"
<P>    "You might say that." The Colonel looked from the speaker to
James and back again. "A British recruit, in fact. I signed him
up bright'n early over at the fort. Showed such an interest in
military engineering, I decided to put him on my staff." The
crowd looked even more mystified when the Colonel suggested to
James in mock courteous tones, "Allow me to show you to your new
quarters, Lieutenant Fielding. We'll need a little time to work
out your next assignment." 
<P>    Taking the new recruit by the shoulder, the Colonel guided
him firmly through the group of onlookers. James' hands, tied
behind his back, became visible to the crowd.
<P>    "Look at that, he's the Colonel's prisoner. Give 'em hell,
Chancy. We'll beat the British yet."
<P>    A chorus of laughter and off-colour remarks followed them
down the street.  It seemed that neither British nor American
military prowess was universally respected in these parts.
<P>    They arrived at a substantial brick building with a U.S.
flag flying from a staff planted beside the front door.
"Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters," announced a plaque on the
wall. 
<P>    "Gimme them keys and fetch a light," yelled Cyrus into an
open room. A startled soldier jumped up where he'd been dozing
at a table. "Yer new office is down in the cellar, Lootenant
Fieldin'. It don't lack no comforts."
<P>    Guffawing merrily, he shoved James roughly ahead of him
through an open door. Apparently, the Colonel's style of humour
had thoroughly infected his subordinate. 
<P>    James stumbled down the stairs into a dank cellar where a
series of iron-studded doors opened off a stone-walled corridor.
Fitting a key to a lock and wrenching it against the rust, Cyrus
ushered him into a narrow cubicle. After severing the rope that
bound his hands, he heartily slammed and relocked the door. 
<P>    A narrow window blocked with rusty bars let in a little
light. Beyond the cobwebbed glass a curtain of ferns grew along
the foundation wall. The cell contained a crude double bunk
covered with disreputable bedding material. In the corner stood
a rickety table and a chair with only three good legs.  A film
of water from some underground source dampened the flagstones of
the floor.
<P>    James settled down on the top bunk to take stock of the
situation. Above the thick, adze-hewn beams, inches from his
forehead, someone paced up and down, stamped heavily, then
scraped a chair across the boards. With each movement overhead,
a shower of fine dust rained down on his face. It reminded him a
little of the earth tossed on the face of a corpse. He felt half
entombed already. His life contained nothing more to look
forward to. He only hoped he could face the trials ahead without
flinching.
<P>    His offense would probably merit serious punishment.
Trespassing, theft and vandalism of U.S. Government property.
But even now, he couldn't quite grasp where the real mistake
lay. Ruin had come so swiftly. He'd not had time to wallow in
sin, to be drawn to his own wickedness, to feel the soul
corrupted by the steady beckoning of evil. The goal had merely
seemed <I>perilous</I> in some sense that was quite appropriate to
high adventure. With minor lapses, he'd been pushed along by
spotless idealism, not seduced by selfish and contemptible
desires. He sighed inwardly. Control of his life had gone out of
his hands.

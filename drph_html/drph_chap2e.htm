<P>    With the novelty of winter long since gone, the mood of the
town was to defer everything until spring breakup. Everything,
that is, except the round of social events. A whirl of balls and
<I>soirees</I> was attended by members of the social elite. Unless it
was an affair of the <I>creme-de-la-creme</I>, the junior officers
were often invited as well.
<P>    "In February and March the town is simply teeming with
eligible widows, bawdy wives and the nubile daughters of rich
fur traders," Major Snell had observed. "Most puzzling where
they all go in the warm weather. Probably off doing their
hunting in the woods by then."
<P>    James viewed these events with a mixture of trepidation and
anticipation. His early days had been filled with the
experiences of fields and woods, his notions of society formed
by prowling the battlements and forges of a fortified town. As
for indoor social life, he'd merely hung about on the periphery
of events such as Christmas balls. Much like any other frontier
lad dragged half-willing into the irrelevancies of polite
society. But Montreal in late February had distinctly indoor
preoccupations.
<P>    Every available officer had been invited to a certain
<I>soiree musicale</I>. "We shall be ruthlessly exploited by our
hostess,"  Major Snell had warned them. "Not for our inherent
virtues. Merely to add that essential element of dash. It is
little short of victimization and should be prohibited by
regulation. You will attend, of course -- for the good of the
regiment."
<P>    Arriving within the crowded halls, they were instantly
surrounded by a horde of refugees from the dreary frosts
outside. Everyone was conversing at the top of their lungs.
<P>    In a city the modest size of Montreal, it was amazing how
many strangers one might encounter. This was as mixed a
gathering as James had ever attended.  He heard snatches of
French and plenty of the Highlands, with now and then a Yankee
twang. The whole uproar was punctuated by the irritating tones
that betoken impeccable breeding. It occurred to him that the
accents of those lately out from England became unnaturally
didactic on these occasions. As if to inculcate habits of good
diction in those of less favoured origin. 
<P>    James "lurked" a good deal at these functions. He moved
constantly from place to place so as not to present a fixed
target. He stood at attention beside pillars, sequestered
himself behind potted ferns. Now and again he would dart across
the room and exchange greetings with a brother officer. It was a
relief to fall into regimental chit-chat, the plans for the
coming season, news from home. He'd not yet found the definitive
reason why he should even be present at these gatherings. A
sense of duty, perhaps. Certainly not to satisfy his own
ambition. And yet, the sight of all those bright feminine eyes,
those bare necks and lightly-clad shoulders, suggested that
something of value was hidden in the confusion. Here, at last,
was the basis for the vague sense of anticipation that led him
to endure all the rest. 
<P>    A string orchestra was sawing away in an adjoining room. The
selections seemed fussy and complicated compared to the music
James was familiar with. Even the pauses to adjust instruments
and re-arrange the music seemed part of the proceedings. You
were expected to remain quiet and not begin clapping too soon,
although the connection of one piece to another was quite
obscure. That they used printed music at all was peculiar. The
fiddlers he'd observed since boyhood all played by ear.
<P>    One of the musicians spoke in a European accent. He
announced the composition of a "Meestaire Eyeden, in sree
moofments. Allegro, andante maestoso, and allegro assai."
Everyone listened politely, fidgeting till the real music began
and the company could dance. That was the moment James was
dreading. With luck, he might simply avoid asking any young lady
for the pleasure. This would give <I>him</I> the pleasure of
remaining unnoticed. For want of useful employment, he
gravitated toward the refreshment table.
<P>    A servant ladled punch in measured amounts. To fill in time,
James studied the minute details of this operation. He watched
the servant dip the ladle into the liquid and raise it to refill
his glass. The ripples slowly died out as the implement remained
poised over its mirror image in the bowl.
<P>    A face appeared for an instant in the reflection. A face
he'd seen last summer, but only for a moment. He looked up, full
into the eyes of the man his father had handed over to Colonel
Enright in the exchange on Lake Ontario. 
<P>    "Sullivan!  ... I thought you'd been deport... er, gone back
to the States." He fumbled for the glass of punch held out to
him by the servant. 
<P>    "The name is Maidstone," replied the other, blinking
rapidly. "Maidstone, of Maidstone, Pottinger and McCormack,
optical merchants. And you, sir, just who may <I>you</I> be?" He put
the last question with narrowed eyes, as if seeking to lay his
own mature talent for impertinence alongside that of this
unfinished cadet.
<P>    "Fielding, sir, of the 49th. ... Attached to the
Commander-in-chief's staff." James recovered quickly, zealous to
repair the social <I>faux pas</I>. "My mistake, sir. I've only
recently come down from Kingston. For a moment I took you for
someone I'd met once before. Now I see only a slight resemblance." 
<P>    "I've never had the dubious pleasure of visiting that town.
My business takes me between this fair city and New York. Now,
if you'll kindly point out Major Snell, I shall be most
obliged." He moved to detach himself from James' company, and
added with a baring of teeth: "I shall not fail to comment to
the Major on the keen powers of observation of his officers.
Perhaps a shipment of spectacles for the entire regiment is in
order." 
<P>    After Major Snell was pointed out, a woman swept forward to
intercept Maidstone. Seizing an elbow, she drew him down to hear
her whisper. At this he abruptly reversed direction and stepped
back toward James.
<P>    "You may atone for your impertinence, Fielding, by providing
Mrs. Maidstone with a little refreshment." Completing this brisk
introduction, he thrust himself into the crowd.
<P>    The woman turned fully round to face James. He instantly
felt his knees go weak, his vision narrow and his sense of
sluggish time accelerate to a sprint.
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone was a woman at the peak of her powers. Of
uncertain age, with large, knowing eyes that seemed to hint at
something between maternal understanding and girlish deviltry.
She was someone who -- however well-clothed -- forced the male
imagination to speculate on the well-upholstered body beneath.
The visible parts of her complexion hinted at an overall quality
that couldn't exactly be described as plump. She possessed, in
fact, all the virtues of the youthful figure. But neither could
she be fairly characterized as slim. The lady had clearly
attained that glorious tumescence of the flesh which is possible
only in a mature woman.
<P>    She held out a hand to James. He touched his lips to the
curving fingers. While doing this, he stole a glimpse up an arm
that was incredible in the fine sculpting of its well-wrought
marble. As he withdrew his lips in a daze, scanning dreamily
from arm to shoulder, across the slopes of those snowy hills,
down the hidden valley that lay between, she spoke.
<P>    "I don't believe we've been properly introduced. You are
a member of a British regiment, I see."
<P>    "F-F-Fielding, ma'am ... of the 49th." He forced himself to
concentrate. She had a surprisingly dulcet tone of voice. But it
was not her voice that impressed him. Amazing that a creature
who could simply beacon forth her essential nature, as it were,
directly into his mind, should bother to utter a word. He just
wanted to gaze at her. "Er, dark in here. I seem to have
mistaken your husband for someone else." 
<P>    "Odd, <I>I</I> would never mistake him for anyone else ... even
in total darkness." She smiled enigmatically and looked directly
into his eyes. 
<P>    James had a premonition of floating on scenic but uncharted
waters. He back-paddled furiously to avoid being sucked into the
chute he knew lay close downstream. It was most peculiar how
"geographical" his impressions of a beautiful woman could be. A
strong impression came over him of being once again on the verge
of a limitless frontier, at the mouth of a mighty but unknown
river, yearning for the mysterious headwaters.
<P>    "Indeed, Ma'am, I was under the illusion we'd met in
Kingston, my home town. ... Have you had the opportunity to
travel in Upper Canada?" 
<P>    "Why, yes. We did pass through Kingston late last summer.
... But <I>you</I>, what of your work here in Montreal?  You do
'work'?  I mean to say, there must be <I>some</I> makeshift
employment between events such as this?"
<P>    She extended an arm with a fine fluidity of movement. At one
gesture she indicated the present company, the flesh of the arm,
and the lovely neck where her hand finally came to rest. But the
discrepancy between the lady's account of her travels and her
husband's earlier remarks did not go unnoticed.
<P>    To his relief, the conversation soon turned to less
demanding topics. Even so, it remained difficult to wrench his
eyes from those newly-interesting features of interior landscape
that loomed so close before him. Here was the real frontier. But
he hoped she didn't notice his furtive exploratory glances. He
had an idea that this was a woman who needed (out of deference
to what was surely a goddess-like purity) to be shielded from a
knowledge of the devastating effects of her own beauty.
<P>    Accordingly, he tried to distract both her and himself with
the more interesting details of his experience in the regiment
so far. He was not at all sure that his work was <I>not</I> makeshift
employment. Certainly, his pursuit of the elusive Colonel
Enright now seemed little more than an empty dream. Then his new
friend on the C.I.C.'s staff came over and rescued him.
<P>    "Ah, Harris, I was about to tell Mrs. Maidstone about our
climb to the top of Mont Ste. Hilaire." 
<P>    "My apologies, Mrs. Maidstone, but I really must spirit him
off. James, the Admiral has put in an appearance. We should pay
our respects."  James turned to put his lips to the exquisite
digits of Mrs. Maidstone. Harris dragged him away in the
opposite direction.
<P>
<P>    "Good to see you again, lads." The Admiral held out his
palms in front of the fire to restore warmth. "Used to more
melting climes, d'you see. Palm trees, tropic islands. A far cry
from the ice shove of the St. Lawrence." He drew James to his
side near the fire. "That was a trim craft you were anchored
alongside, my boy. The lady you were speaking to, d'ye know her
well?" 
<P>    "I'm told her name is Maidstone, sir. At first I mistook her
husband for someone I'd already met." 
<P>    "A first-rate ship-of-the-line," suggested Harris.
<P>    The Admiral's weather eye narrowed. "More like a frigate,
Harris. She's got the trim lines, the speed and manoeuvrability.
The eyes and ears of the enemy fleet. ... Or perhaps she's
really a privateer. What d'you think, m'lads?"
<P>    James merely chuckled politely. He could hardly conceive of
such an exquisite creature being subject to bantering satire.
Harris had a good laugh and responded easily.
<P>    "May I ask, sir, how you would classify the lady of the
house? Fishing trawler or bomb-ketch?" Harris' clever wit and
easy familiarity with his betters was making James increasingly
irritable.
<P>    The Admiral's eye turned to a stately woman who was making
the rounds at the other side of the room. She was greeted by
much bowing and polite smiling by the guests. "None other than
Nelson's flagship, <I>Victory</I>. See how they all fire off salutes
as she passes." They laughed briefly, but now the Admiral's face
grew serious as he turned to James. 
<P>    "You are snugly dry-docked by now?"
<P>    "Well enough, sir. Though I fear I'm a little out of my
element at the moment." 
<P>    "I know the feeling. A ship out of water, a sailor on the
beach. We must have you refloated as soon as possible. By the
way, you'll be glad to know that the incident which brought you
to Montreal last summer has not been forgotten. Preparations are
underway to strengthen our boundary claims beyond the
Lake-of-the-Woods."
<P>    "May I ask what is being done, sir? I have always felt the
British claims were not pressed with sufficient vigour."
<P>    He paused, noticing that Mr. Maidstone -- keeping his back
turned all the while -- had drifted into their immediate
vicinity. James resumed more quietly, conscious the Admiral was
now listening to him with a fixed stare.
<P>    "I'm sorry, sir, I spoke presumptuously."
<P>    "Ahem. Not at all, young man. You will be made aware of the
relevant details in due course." He leaned forward to speak in a
whisper. "In the meantime, have a care for privateers, m'lad.
... And now, I must leave. You both have full authority to make
the most abject apologies on my behalf. There's one advantage to
being an admiral. They all give way if you choose to slip your
cable and sail out of harbour on a moment's notice." The
conspiratorial whisper again. "Oh, before I forget. Will you
kindly deliver this packet to the Governor's secretary? The
man's upped anchor and gone out ahead of me."
<P>    He shook hands with each of them, then looked at James. "You
were <I>not</I> mistaken, my boy." Turning, he disappeared into the
crowd.
<P>    "Mistaken about what?" wondered Harris.
<P>    "Blowed if I know." James' listless eye wandered over the
gathering. Across the room, Mrs. Maidstone passed a gap in the
throng and hoisted a signal of recognition. He gripped Harris'
arm. "Smile back at Mrs. Sullivan, or Mrs. Maidstone, or whoever
she is," he whispered, "I think I know what the Admiral meant
about privateers."
<P>    The orchestra had finished the third movement. Or was it the
eleventh? Now they prepared to regale the audience with tunes of
less artistic merit but greater popular appeal. Harris dashed
off on his own mysterious errands, leaving James casting about
for shelter. He eventually spied a quiet avenue to make his
retreat and stepped briskly through a doorway leading to an
anteroom. To his supreme embarrassment, he came into smart
collision with a young woman who was making her entrance at the
same moment. 
<P>    "My apologies, Miss."
<P>    He barely restrained an idiot urge to smooth the front of
her dress before the orchestra went into a prelude to the first
dance. Guests began moving to the area set aside for dancing.
She held her ground and stared at him expectantly. He thought of
offering her a glass of punch but it was too late for retreat.
<P>    "... I would be most happy if you would give me the pleasure
of the first dance," said he without pleasure.
<P>    He knew he'd just made a fatal tactical error. The young
woman accepted with a nod of her head.
<P>    James led his partner to the dance floor and they took up
positions. Luckily, the piece was so traditional that even a
Kingston boy might know the correct evolutions. As he got the
hang of it, he realized she was a young beauty. Near enough to
his own age to be a sister. She seemed altogether more real,
more attainable than the Aphrodite whose fingers he'd nibbled
beside the punchbowl. The face and neck were slimmer, simpler.
None of those gorgeous modulations of the flesh that were so
rivetting in Mrs. Maidstone. The front of her gown did nothing
to encourage the idle mind to plot imaginative excursions. The
attractiveness of younger women, he decided, lay in a certain
freshness. A kind of modest charm you might compare to spring
flowers, violets, perhaps. Her expression seemed positive.
Perhaps she'd allow him a few moments' conversation afterward.
<P>    The orchestra scraped through to the finale. James coped
adequately, if woodenly, with the simple measures. But out of
the corner of his eye he was distracted by the very antithesis
of those subtle virtues he'd noticed in his present partner. The
ravishing Mrs. Maidstone surged into close proximity. A rose in
full bloom, a compendium of every June delight. With his eyes on
the flower of womanhood, he trod squarely on the girlish buds of
May. 
<P>    The dance was almost over and the mortified James helped his
victim to a seat. There she sat with closed eyes and clenched
teeth, nursing her crushed toes. He hurried off to fetch her
something to drink. By the time he'd forced his way back through
the crowd, she'd disappeared. He stood with the glass in his
hand wishing the floor would open up and deposit him in the root
cellar. Some older women sitting nearby were looking in his
direction. He was sure they must be laughing at him when they
turned hurriedly away, shoulders heaving. Heading for the
entrance, he was desperate to get outside for a breath of air. A
hot flush stole up from under his collar and spread to his
cheeks.
<P>    "Ensign Fielding," pealed a feminine voice. "Please come
back, we have need of you."
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone and some other ladies beckoned. He couldn't
imagine why anyone had need of him. He was already wondering
how he could gracefully end his military career and retire to a
trapper's cabin in the woods. Surely, his usefulness to the
regiment would be ended when word of this fiasco got out. 
<P>    "Ladies, may I present someone who well represents British
pluck and determination. Ensign Fielding was about to regale me
with <I>lurid</I> tales of frontier adventure when he was called away
to consult with Admiral Fisher. Now we have him all to
ourselves." I consent to exhibit this young meteorite, she
seemed to say. Nevertheless, keep your distance.
<P>    Fielding allowed himself to be led to an anteroom where he
held forth for what seemed an hour or more, his eyes glued on
the fascinating Mrs. Maidstone. He did not fail to notice,
however, when her husband reappeared and leaned negligently on
the doorpost, saying nothing, listening to his every word.
<P>
<P>    The soiree broke up at a late hour, with James and Harris
strolling back to quarters in the crisp night air. James
indulged himself in bleak brooding about his unattainable lady
of the punchbowl, her scowling husband, his own clumsiness on
the dance floor, and the splitting headache that had been
creeping up on him all evening.
<P>    "You know, Harris, I had a feeling that Maidstone was
listening for information. So I switched stories in the middle and
gave 'em some silly yarn about camping out in the wilderness.
Bloody spy. How the deuce does a woman like that get stuck with
the likes of him?"
<P>    "Yes, well, I <I>was</I> about to suggest -- but I see you've
come to much the same conclusion -- that it might be prudent to
remain silent about the Sackets Harbor incident. At least till
we see the final outcome. The Admiral has, shall we say,
confided certain matters ..." 
<P>    "What're you blithering about, Harris?" Sudden anger shook
him. "Confided?  Or do you mean 'confounded'?"
<P>    How was it that <I>he</I>, the original discoveror of Colonel
Enright's schemes, should remain in the dark while everyone else
enjoyed privileged information?
<P>    "What the devil's going on, Harris? And how does your precious
Admiral know, may I ask, that Sullivan and Maidstone are one and
the same? And why should he 'confide' in the likes of you, while
I'm told nothing?"
<P>    "Well, if you <I>must</I> know, we <I>do</I> have certain connections
back in the Old Country. And the Admiral <I>is</I> a bit of a scholar
where skulduggery is concerned."
<P>    James strode on in a mounting rage.  It all came back in a
rush. That egregiously-English snob of a Major at the Governor's
house who'd tried to keep him and his father in their proper
places, despite the news they carried. The future of the colony
be damned. Keep to your station and mind your betters. The
garrison was infested with insufferably arrogant officers. For
some, mere lack of the right accent would elicit tirades against
the barbarous manners and deficient education of the colonies.
... On second thought, perhaps they were right about the
barbarous manners.
<P>    He stamped onward, re-living the evening's embarrassment.
His yokel's upbringing had been put on public view. The only
thing that rescued him from total despair was his bachelor's
sense of righteous indignation. An instinct that rebelled at
seeing a desirable woman hitched up to an unworthy charlatan
(and, incidentally, taken out of circulation.) The rest of the
world, except him, enjoyed a monopoly of privilege. If it wasn't
the addle-brained, it was the wicked, flourishing as the green
bay tree. With Maidstone leading the pack. Now, to cap it off,
here was his supposed friend, claiming mysterious relationships
with the lordly Admiral Fisher. 
<P>   "And who, indeed, are <I>you</I>, sir?" he snarled over his
shoulder at Harris.
<P>    "I say, James ... I <I>am</I> dreadfully sorry if I've said
anything to offend ..." Harris was slipping into a caricature of
the very diction calculated to make the colonial blood boil. He
hurried to catch up with James. "You might at least let me try
to explain ..."
<P>    Hissing out of a dark alley, a dagger just missed James. The
weapon clattered against a stone wall and dislodged a fragment
of mortar. "Down!" croaked Harris. He pushed his sulking friend
into the shadows and stopped James' mouth with his hand. Their
eyes bulged at the sudden reversal.
<P>    Stealthy footsteps crept up and a rough voice whispered,
"Cawn't see nuthink. E's bloody well <I>disappeared</I>! What'll we
do now, Sully?" 
<P>    A second voice: "Clear out, you idiot! You were supposed to
make it look like robbery, not murder." Two figures erupted from
the mouth of the alley and bolted in opposite directions.
<P>    "Follow that one," shouted Harris.
<P>    James took the lead with Harris calling advice from the
rear. Stumbling down the dark street, he had little to follow but
the crunch of the man's footfalls on the icy crust. Then, a
silhouette bounded through a patch of light cast by a tavern
window.
<P>    "Head him off to the left," gasped Harris.
<P>    They crossed an open square and rounded the statue of a
general on a horse. James cut the man off by swinging wide to
the right. The fugitive obediently turned left and darted up a
narrow side street.
<P>    Harris came up from behind. "Now we've got him. It's a blind
alley. He can't get away. You take the left and I'll keep
opposite. Search every doorway and alcove."
<P>    As they crept down the alley, James realized they'd
neglected to pick up their assailant's knife. Between them, they
hadn't so much as a stick of wood for protection. 
<P>    Inside the dim <I>cul-de-sac</I>, they could barely make out the
main features.  An archway gave onto another dark passage. They
closed in from both sides, crunching noisily on the snow,
prepared to pounce, praying the fugitive carried no additional
weapons. At the end, their hands met at a wooden wall with a
door let into it.
<P>    "He must've gone inside," whispered James. In the same
instant, the door burst open and a man backed out. 
<P>    "Va coucher, mon cheri. A demain," he shouted into the
interior, slamming the door and blundering easily into their
arms. "ASSASSINS! Voleurs! Au secours!" he shrieked at the top
of his lungs, abruptly twisting free and running pell-mell down
the alley. "Voleurs. Assassins," he bellowed again as the two
stood dumbfounded.
<P>    Harris wrenched open the door, to be greeted by the rich
aroma of hay and horse manure. A lamp came on in an upper window
down the alley. 
<P>    "Come, James, best be off. Otherwise, we may find ourselves
with considerable explaining in front of the magistrates
tomorrow morning. If we linger here much longer, the watch will
arrest us as a pair of common footpads."

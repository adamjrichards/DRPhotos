<BR> * Actually devouring the apples, contrary to the ladybug's
carnivorous, fellow bug-eating reputation.
<BR> * As in, Secret Storm on the Edge of Night General Hospital --
the soap opera. That blue thing beyond the woodpile is the remains
of an IKEA shelf unit. Deemed too useless and too awful to let live.
Condemned since then to be a floor unit for the compost heap.
 Our cast-iron "krater" peeks out on the left from a tangle of creeper
vines. My conceit is to compare it to an overwrought classical specimen
known as the Derveni Krater and found in Macedonia -- a relic of late
flourishing artistic inspiration around the time of Alexander.
And before the neighbours arrived to focus everyone's mind on
"peace, order and good (Roman) government."
<BR> * that makes me want to preserve it for at least part of eternity.
 ..<BR> * Preciosity? A writ-guru I once had, opined that preciosity was loving
something more than God does. But this presents a theological problem. If God
is all-wise, all-knowing and all-good, then He is not selfish and does NOT
love Himself, right? So then, to avoid preciosity, I should not love God more
than He loves Himself. In fact, be indifferent or at least slightly dislike
the guy. 
 ..<BR> * So, either compost or combust in senior-common room hell, writ-crit
guru. God is watching. In fact God's hand is afoot, and you're
gonna get the divine boot.
<P><B>2015-10-31  AGO Turner exhib</B>
<BR> * Turner seemed to have loved storms and ocean waves. Waves in all
their forms do have a certain interest.

<BR> * Was this just a fluke button-push? Or did I really have a
composition in mind?
<P><B>2015-10-31  Halloween in FH Village</B>
<BR> * Is it the wide eyes and open jaws? Or is this just the
try-it-on-for-size gambit of a gaffer in his eighth decade.
<BR> * One of the ones that roost in our backyard trees.
<P><B>2015-11-01  Martin bench unveiling</B>
* Kenneth organized the bench project.
<P><B>2015-11-01  Bench is in Cedarvale Park</B>
<BR> * The path is well-used.
<BR> * These weren't part of the Turner show at the AGO.
<BR> * What was the story, Merle?

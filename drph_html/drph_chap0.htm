<BR clear='all'><P>    Darting a glance over the rim of his wineglass, he played
for time and pretended to savour the Madeira. It struck him as
odd that so mellow a flavour should carry with it memories he'd
much rather keep secret. In fact, it was a cask of Madeira his
father had used to buy him freedom from American detention in
the summer of 1815, nearly two years before.
<BR clear='all'><P>    "You'd better begin your story, or we'll be anchoring off
Honolulu before you get finished," prompted Mr. Pritchard, the
owner of the vessel. "We must catch the tide, if we're to get
over the bar safely."
<BR clear='all'><P>    Mellow be damned! He jumped from his seat, aware at last of
the banks of the Columbia River slipping by the windows of the
ship's cabin. A dinner invitation was fast becoming a voyage.
His confusion was masked by the lady sitting opposite,
apparently seized by a choking fit.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "I must say," observed his host when this interruption was
settled, "I'm amazed at how young you seem, to have survived so
many adventures. And to have brought your lovely ... wife through
such hostile country. ... Please excuse my curiosity."
<BR clear='all'><P>   The lady was looking innocent in the depths of a familiar
scarlet-embroidered handkerchief. She winked and he knew he'd
left youth far behind. It was she who had lured him on board
this ship. He stared in renewed wonder and pondered what her
motives could be. For a moment he thought he could see the
answer in the flash of her eyes.
<BR clear='all'><P>   The contest between him and this beautiful woman might have
begun in international rivalry. But that hint of intrigue was
only a startling reminder of something he'd nearly forgotten:
the distant reflection of a face in a punch bowl at a <I>soiree
musicale</I> in Montreal. A once-deadly rival in love -- now
vanquished by fate, dead and mouldering somewhere in the Pembina
hills.
<BR clear='all'><P>   In the beginning it was eagerness to combat the foe and find
adventure. Now he was facing the surprising consequences of
those youthful desires.
<BR clear='all'><P>   She alone knew he was a very young and very expendable
British officer, responsible to a far off and eccentric admiral
for clandestine operations on the frontiers of North America.
But to the trappers and traders of the west coast, he was the
go-ahead rescuer of a U.S. expedition whose bad luck could be
blamed on the British. Circumstance was turning him into an
American hero. And at this moment, he was drinking the very
agreeable wine of a patriotic Yankee ship owner.
<BR clear='all'><P>   She would never betray him, of that he was certain. But what
gave him such a premonition of jagged reefs in the depths of
those grey-green eyes?
 <BR clear='all'><P>  It seemed best to lie as little as possible. Merely to
"reinterpret" the facts from a more convenient viewpoint -- the
viewpoint of a dead man. It had all started as a prank, a
confused night landing on the shores of Lake Ontario near
Sackets Harbor. But for this particular listener, better to skip
over the wild schemes of youth.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "Hmm, where to begin. Actually, we'd just heard the news of
Waterloo. I was travelling secretly in the Canadas, following
the trail of a certain footloose English admiral, Fisher, by
name." He took another sip. Rather good, actually. But it was
time to put on an American twang. Get into the knockabout spirit
of the thing. He slapped his thigh for jocular emphasis and
continued in more nasal tones.
<BR clear='all'><P>   "Well, sir, the war was hardly over and this old buzzard was
already scouting out American defences close by to British
territory. I may tell you, Mr. Pritchard, just between us, he
was up to no good for the Republic.  And then I had the bad luck
to be put in irons by the military authorities in Kingston. A
bunch of stuffed shirts -- especially that crusty old artillery
officer who arranged my release. What was his name, my dear,
Meadows? Bush? ... Ah, now I remember. <I>Fielding</I> was the man."
<BR clear='all'><P>   As the wine began to work, a wave of nostalgia for his own
colourful past swept over him. Here he was, already yarning
about the "good old days", and only just turned eighteen.

<P>
<P>        Waterton is a Parks Canada townsite smugly situated at
the head of Waterton Lake and surrounded by more than a fair
share of heroic scenery. After breaking camp and scouting around
town for a post office, we visit the Prince of Wales Hotel.
It is at the edge of town on a natural dam overlooking the
outlet of the lake. Try to imagine a kind of Bavarian hunting
lodge with soaring roofs, vaguely reminiscent of the Chateau
school of architecture as seen in Canadian railway stations and
hotels. The general conception reminds me of Neuschwanstein
Castle.  Built by some mad King Ludwig of the hostelry business,
it towers over the lake and town below, challenging even the
mountains with its audacity.

<P>        Next, we hike up Bear's Rump trail which overlooks the
hotel. It takes only half an hour to get up to the lookout and
so we continue on up the ridge, for an even better view. Here
is a higher level of difficulty than we have never encountered
before. The slope is not quite steep enough to require a
rope, but those gulfs of yawning space are much closer than
before. This is no longer an ordinary hiking trail and every
yard of ascent involves strenuous clambering. The sky overhead
is clear but blustery; ragged clouds are forming behind the
ridge and threatening to swoop down on us.  After resting awhile
near the treeline, we turn back.

<P>        We drive to Red Rock Canyon and see Blakiston Falls.
We tour round the Buffalo Pound and see those majestic cattle in
a facsimile of their natural habitat.  Then we leave the area
and go north to Pincher Creek and the Crow's Nest Pass. In
the pass we see the Leitch Colliery historical site at Police
Flats; workmen are just finishing the installation of
interpretive exhibits as we arrive.

<P>        At Frank Slide the evidence of the rockfall that wiped
out a village is overwhelming; the brow of the cliff overhangs
the valley, still meditating ruin. At the top of the pass is the
site of a recent forest fire, with interpretive trails providing
a cautionary lesson to the visitor. The pass itself is
disappointing: too low and too easy to have been the one taken
by the Ames Expedition. I am surprised by the continuous
settlement and industry on the way through; it is an
old-established coal-mining area. With all the fuss over Crow's
Nest Pass freight rates, you might expect a tortuous ascent in
low gear up steep winding roads and through dank tunnels.  But
instead of a route built at an untold cost in lives and
treasure, you have a broad corridor providing an easy path to
the B.C. interior with only very modest grades. 
<P>        Had not been for Colonel Enright's navigation error,
following the interception of that spurious heliograph message
from Maidstone, the pass would have been put on the map in 1816.
As it was, it had to wait until ___. The peculiar thing is, that
the discovery of the pass should have come so late, particularly
since the local Indians are supposed to have known of it. 
<P>       On the western slope of the great divide, we find a
campsite at Fernie, B.C.  Here, there is a lush growth of
forest; the area just west of the divide snags the clouds going
east; a heavy rain had just fallen and the trees were still wet
with rain. Our campsite has a picnic table whose top consists
of one massive piece of wood, covered with some deep varnish -
the most luxurious we have seen at any campsite so far.

Departed: 8:42
Arrived : 17:00 At Castle Mountain C.G. near Banff, Alberta
<P>
<P>        Reaching the Kootenay river we turn north.  The road
skirts long smooth stretches of green water.  We learn that
steamboats once plied this river, coming from as far south as
Montana. At the head of the river is a marshy lake which is
connected to the river by a channel know as McGillivray's
Portage [?].  At one time a steamboat was able to get through
here but the route was scuttled by international disagreement on
water levels. The lake also drains north into the Columbia and
since the Kootenay is a tributary of the Columbia, this means
that a vast tract of interior B.C. and the adjoining
American states is, in effect, an island in the Columbia River.
<P>        Somewhere to the west, lies that high pass which both
the Enright Overland Expedition and the Ames Expedition crossed
to reach the interior. Somewhere on the shores of this lake lies
the ruin of that fort temporarily occuppied by Colonel Enright
following his desperate escape across the mountains. The exact
locations of the Colonel's grave and the rickety palisade which
he attempted to defend against the attack of disgruntled
Kootenay Indians have not been discovered. It was here that
James Fielding was nearly lynched by Enright's desperate men and
where, by the intervention of Catherine Maidstone, the execution
was stayed and the victim launched on a peculiar career as an
American popular hero.

<P>        Toady we visit Fort Steele, a recreation of the
original frontier town.  I hear German spoken by numerous
tourists and there is a guide who greets visitors in that
language. The town is laid out with streets arranged in a square
round a central common. Inside the buildings, rooms are
furnished and decorated in period style.  In the yards,
vegetable and flower gardens flourish.  I stroll down the
street and spy a carpenter on a roof, hammering down cedar
shingles.  For a moment as the echoes die away, the illusion is
nearly perfect and I am carried back to similar sights and
sounds from my own youth in a village in the Eastern Townships
of Quebec. A stage-coach rattles down the street, giving rides
to the kiddies.  The illusion evaporates; my memory will not
carry me back quite that far. Outside the gate, a steam
locomotive waits in the station for passengers. That I do
remember. The engine has a unique propulsion system with the
crankshaft running lengthwise under the boiler and geared to the
wheels.

<P>        We go over the Vermillion Pass today.   It is low with
gradual approaches, no more suitable than the Crow's Nest Pass
as a model for the site of Col. Enright's disastrous encounter
with the Piegan Indians.
<P>        We set up camp outside Banff - another delightful
Parks Canada tourist trap. We stroll down the main drag
to the Banff Springs Hotel: an attractive building in the
Neuschwanstein style, busy and prosperous.  The hotel looks down
across its terrace to an opening in the mountains where the Bow
[?] River flows out to the foothills. The location is almost too
good to be true; below the terrace is a waterfall; above it
looms the long, even flank of Mt. Rundle, an upraised slab of
rock, terminating in a sheer drop. You can watch climbing
adventures (or tragedies) from your hotel room window. Mt.
Rundle is the very model of the type of peak scaled by Fielding
and Harris when they sighted Col. Enright's camp in the
interior. We decide to splurge on steaks at "Drifter's"
Restaurant.

<P>
<P>        Arriving early at Lake Louise, we find the lawns beside
the lake crowded with Japanese tourists pointing Nikons at the
famous view. Unfortunately, the famous view is covered with
mist; they have come all that distance, only to be defeated by
the weather. They take pictures of each other and us against a
backdrop of fog, climb on their tour bus and roar off to the
next stop on the itinerary. 
<P>        We hang about waiting for the fog to clear and decide to
pass the time strolling by the lake. It can't hurt to
stretch our legs and a sign says encouraging things about a tea
house not far ahead. 
<P>        Halfway down the lake, the clouds begin to lift and we
have tantalising glimpses of the lower flanks of the surrounding
peaks.  By the time we reach the far end of the lake, the
tops of these peaks are beginning to peep out through tatters of
cloud, so we decide to continue walking. So far, the path has
been wide and smooth; beyond this, it climbs upward, following
the valley of that glacial torrent which feeds Lake Louise. 
<P>       The teahouse, apparently, is still miles ahead but we've
got our hiking boots on and soon outdistance the more bourgeois
pedestrians keeping to the path beside the lake. You think of a
tea house as a place frequented by aunties with blue veins on
the backs of their hands, and the bouquet on the tea table would
be woodland violets, not edelweiss.  But the path climbs higher
through the woods and up along the side of the valley.  Down in
its ravine, the brook foams its way to Lake Louise between high
banks of piled stone, the ruins of glacial moraines and ancient
rockfalls.  Far ahead, the highest icefields glitter, now
exposed to view as the last banners of cloud are torn loose by
the breeze.  A distant crash stops us in our tracks.  We are
unable to place the exact origin of the sound: blasting
operations, a sonic boom, perhaps.

<P>        We continue up the track.  Down in the valley to our
left, the brook is now flanked by two steep ridges of glacial
debris, lateral moraines, thrust aside by the glacier hundreds
or thousands of years ago and, today, still clear of any
vegetation.  Leaving the trail, I am able to get down to the
nearer ridge and tramp along the knife-edge where there is a
path of sorts.  Merle continues on up the approved route to the
tea house with a party of hikers.  My own path leads up the
valley past fields of stony debris toward the edge of the
glacier. The transition from gravel to ice is gradual.  On my
left, the snout of the nearest glacier is so melted and covered
with debris as to seem a part of the valley floor. I scramble up
the razor-back of the moraine to a point where I can look down
into a giant fissure. In the depths of the glacier, the ice
shines blue-green.

<P>        At the highest point on the moraine, I am able to get a
sight of Lake Louise back down the valley. The hotel is visible
on the opposite side of the lake. The spine of the moraine is
quite sharp at this point and while I am shakily replacing the
film in my camera, I estimate there is a non-zero risk of
sliding down the gravel bank onto the glacier below.  I turn
around slowly. At my back, the valley expands into a wide cirque
where 5 [?](count them, 5) glaciers can be seen at once. 
<P>        I strike out off the moraine to rejoin Merle at the tea
house. It must be somewhere above me, one would think, among the
trees on the side of the valley, surely. Fighting my way up
through dense thickets of waist-high spruce bushes, I cast about
for signs of civilization. The gound is running with tiny
streams; everywhere there is the gurgle of decending rivulets
among the stones. Hmmm, a nice pot of tea, brewed from the water
of a sparkling mountain stream, that would be about right just
now. But where is the tea house? Finally, I locate a trail
leading ever higher up into the mountains.  This will never do,
and then I recall that these things are bidirectional and
wisely follow it backward down to the highest patch of forest on
the shoulder of the valley.  Here the tea house is conveniently
located, and there is Merle waiting for me at the end of the
trail which comes up from the lake.

0226-33 83-08-17 - The high-level teahouse.</P>

<P>        It is an alpine-style stone building with an
overhanging balcony on the second floor.  We find a table
on the balcony and order soup, sandwiches and tea. Then we feast
our eyes on the view, our stomachs on the food. You meet quite a
variety of interesting people in this sort of place; the
challenge and the scenery seem to bring out a slightly eccentric
and good-natured kind of individual.  Or is this simply a case
of "rapture" of the heights, a condition which sometimes
afflicts perfectly normal, surly individuals? The first symptom
is that you begin to say "howdy" a lot and experience little
difficulty in speaking to strangers.  Then you start grinning
idiotically and begin to feel you are partners with everyone you
meet in some splendid mountaineering enterprise.  Another thing
I have noticed is that everyone seems to come from some obscure
and far-away place.   But this is obviously a delusion, since
the odds against meeting two people on a mountain top from Tulsa
and Semipalatinsk at the same time are one in 8.26 times 10 to
the 7th power. 
<P>        Over lunch, we learn that the trail continues up the
valley to an even higher vantage point. We decide to follow it.
After the meal, we toss a few crumbs to a marmot sitting on a
rock; he is the local toll-booth keeper, collecting scraps of
food from hikers. Marmots have a whistling call which you cannot
mistake for any other animal. 
<P>        The trail has now reached the treeline and all that
remains of the forest are stands of low bushes in a few
protected locations.  We pass an area where the scrub trees
beside the trail have been stripped of bark and foliage; the
peeled stems point downward into the ravine. I begin to
understand the origin of those mysterious rumblings and crashes
we have been hearing all morning. Slicing downward, an avalanche
must had passed by last winter at just about our present head
level.  We continue the ascent up another long moraine,
eventually reaching a point where the path hits a sheer
mountain wall.  It is the top end of the trail, we must quit
or become climbers. 
<P>        We rest under the cliff, a little awestruck by the
view, and stare up at the glacier hanging down from Abbott
Pass.  Visible at the top, is a hut maintained by the Alpine
Club of Canada and normally reached from the opposite side. The
hut is provided with the highest privy in Canada.  Since it
rests on the Great Divide, you have the honour of knowing, when
you use it, that you have contributed to the enrichment of the
both the Pacific and Arctic Oceans. 
<P>        On the right and towering overhead is a sheer cliff
topped by a glacier. In places, the ice hangs over the edge.  A
startling concussion rivets our attention. Somewhere above, the
icefield fractures in the heat of noonday and a cloud of
fragments hurtles down the cliff face a few hundred yards away.
There is also the sound of rushing water. Behind this vantage
point and up a slope of loose rock, a water fall is fed by the
same ice field, plunging off the top of the cliff and rushing
down the side of the moraine. We climb to the base of the
waterfall, selecting every toehold with care and taking extra
precaustions not to dislodge stones. I am conscious that we have
attained the modest limit of our climbing experience and can go
no further. Reaching the waterfall, we satisfy our thirst by
drinking melt water running directly out of the glacier and into
our mouths.
<P>
<P>                        ***
<P>
<P>        The highway up the Sunwapta Pass provides the most
exciting piece of automotive mountain climbing we have done
to date. There are plenty of switchbacks to provide a challenge
to the car's cooling system and lookouts where you park and peer
over the edge to exclaim, "Did we really come from way down
there?". The top is well above the treeline and serves
as a jumping-off point to hikes on the high alpine meadows. At
last, we have found a model for that pass over which Colonel
Enright was compelled by bad weather and hostile Indians to
flee in disarray.
<P>        We arrive at Glacier Camp, which is just on the other
side of the pass, and pitch our tent.   Right away, I can
tell this is a camping spot of a different sort:  lots of
low-slung, alpine tents, women with braids, men with checked
flannel shirts, beards and great knobbly boots.   As they
unpack their gear I can see long coils of nylon rope and
hear the clink of climbing iron-mongery. 
<P>        We stand around the campfire in a drizzle and discuss
the prospects with our fellow mountaineers. Nothing can depress
me in a place like this. We are no longer hemmed-in by
mountains; we are up among the summits on a footing of equality
with the high peaks. It is the base camp of a march to a new and
unfamiliar territory. 
<P>        We meet a student from Switzerland on vacation. What
else would a Swiss on vacation do but go and look at somebody
else's alps?  He has hitched a ride from California with an
American and they have just arrived by motorcycle, shortly after
we have taken the last campsite. Never mind, always room for
another member of the brotherhood. The motorcyclist has ideas
about doing a little climbing in the morning and soon joins
forces with our neighbour in the adjoining campsite. They huddle
around the campfire and plan an early morning assault on Mt.
Athabaska. Out of self-defense, I am forced to discuss
computers, reverting to my backup identity. Just before turning
in, I happen to look up into the drizzle and notice a single
star, directly overhead.

<P>        We have trouble sleeping as the temperature dips to the
freezing point. The tents are pitched on wooden platforms to
compensate for the irregularities of the site.  I toss and
turn, having grown used to a mattress of springy turf or pine
needles. We wake up with the campsite in deep shadow. On looking
out of the tent I see the sky is blue and nearly cloudless. I
stroll around the campsite. Mt. Athabaska, is visible in the
distance behind an intervening ridge; it reflects a dazzling
light from its icefields. A bottle of water left outdoors is
partially frozen and one of the picnic tables is covered with a
sheet of glare ice. 
<P>        Roger and Mike, the two climbers from the next campsite,
invite us to hike up to the Athabaska Glacier with them.  This
is the point where they will set out on the final leg of their
climb. We wolf down granola in the frosty air, pack our gear
and set out. The approach to the mountain is located up a side
road not far from the point where the glacier tours set out. We
park the cars down in the flats below the glacier (still far
above the treeline) and set out through meadows of Alpine
flowers. The climbers' access path soon strikes off the road and
wanders up a lateral moraine leading to the foot of the glacier.
As we ascend, pausing frequently to get our wind, the whole
valley begins to open up and the parking lot shrinks to the
point where we have to use binoculars to see the car.
<P>        And then the path gets much rougher. After an hour of
steep uphill walking, we are faced with an energetic scramble up
a slope of earthy debris guarded at the top by a bristling
protrusion of the underlying rock. We make our way past this
obstruction using whatever chancy holds we can find on the
rotten cliff, taking care not to start an avalanche. Past the
barrier, we continue up the moraine to the edge of the glacier
where it meets the solid flank of the mountain. Behind us, in
case you were noticing Merle, the view has grown more stunning
with every foot of altitude gained.  Now you can focus your
eagle's eye far across the valley to a high pass, hidden
from ordinary birds down below, and there will build our
aerie. 
<P>         We continue the ascent and eventually reach the top
of the moraine where we say goodbye to our friends. They
gallop down the other side and began to organize their
equipment at the foot of the glacier. Breaking the ice of a
pool of melt water, they fill their canteens while we sit and
watch them.  The preparations seem to take a long time, as they
carefully adjust straps, repack rucksacks and put on down vests.
At length they are ready; standing in deep shadow, they face a
steep wall of melting ice before they can even reach the surface
of the glacier. They begin tiptoeing up the wall on the points
of their crampons, hacking footsteps as they go. At the top,
they pause to wave good bye, on a level again with our own
position as we sit opposite them on the top of the moraine. They
set off across a mile-wide sheet of hard ice, probing the
surface with ice axes. They strike out for the far side where
the surface slopes more steeply upward, forming a ramp which
will give them access to the summit of the mountain. 
<P>         We turn to explore the moraine.  Around us is a
collection of tent platforms built out of stones. They have been
constructed by climbers, hoping, no doubt, to arrive late in
the day and get an early start the next morning.  Some have
waist-high walls to keep off the wind, painstakingly constructed
of flat rocks. We eat lunch in a miniature fortification where
we could have kept off an army, if we had been Afghan rebels.
... Well, if we can be eagles, we certainly should have no
trouble becoming Afghan rebels. 
<P>       In a low spot near the top of the moraine, is an island
of ice with a pool in the middle of it about forty feet across.
In the pool, rocks are floating. We approach and discover that
the rocks are embedded in clear ice and covered with a thin
layer of melt water.  We throw snowballs and lie down to make
"angels" on the banks surrounding the pool.
<P>       We decide to take a different route down so we can
explore a rampart that overhangs the main glacier. I edge my way
up the cliff overlooking a gulf of empty space on one side and
finally reach a point where my desire to see over the edge is
just balanced by my fear of falling two thousand feet straight
down. Below is the main glacier. Buses with caterpillar tracks
crawl across the surface taking tourists out onto the icesheet.
There is a feeling of privilege in such a view - seeing from a
great height without being seen - the affairs of ordinary
citizens laid out for critical inspection.
<P>        On the opposite side of the valley, we spy out routes
for future hikes. There is a certain high pass, saddle-shaped,
which is almost a model for the pass where the Ames Expedition
camped while following the track of Colonel Enright over the
Great Divide. There is even a peak which overlooks the pass on
one side and the main valley on the other.  It was from such a
peak that James and Harris saw through their telescope the Stars
and Stripes flying over the Colonel's camp near the headwaters
of the Columbia.
<P>
<P>        From the parking lot at the bottom, I train my
binoculars on the glacier for the last time.  Far above the
highest point that we had reached, I glimpse two figures near
the top of the icefield and moving steadily upward. Our
companions have succeeded in reaching a position which will give
them access to the summit via the highest ridges of the peak.  A
plume of drifting snow sweeps past them, but they continue
steadily upward.  Down in the parking lot, it is beginning to
get hot and the eyepieces of my binoculars fogs up, still
chilled, I suppose, from the cold of the glacier. I looked
again, but the two figures have vanished into a world of their
own. 
<P>        On to Jasper.  I discover while mailing film that I have
taken two rolls with the camera set at the wrong film
speed; this as the result of being sold Kodachrome 64 instead of
Kodachrome 25 in Banff.  For the rest of the day, I am too
depressed to take a serious interest in photography.
<P>        Rounding Jasper Lake, we notice how the scenery has
changed. The grey peaks have shoulders that seem more rounded;
the spruce trees in the wide valleys have a certain uniform,
grey-green quality that seems sub-arctic, distant.  Miette's
Rock, almost the last peak before going out onto the foothills,
is mentioned in Paul Kane's account. Here, a certain voyageur
named Miette is supposed to have climbed up on a dare, to sit
with his legs dangling over the edge. 
<P>        We drive through Edmonton and continue past to a
campsite at Pembina River.   There, we heat water over the
campfire for sponge baths in the privacy of our tent.

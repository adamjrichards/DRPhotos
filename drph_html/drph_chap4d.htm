<P>    Maidstone clenched his jaw, shut his eyes, and tried to
ignore the jabber of voices whirling round him. Somehow, he'd
survived the trip back to camp without passing out. But it was
no tribute to the mercy of his "rescuers". They'd rigged a crude
stretcher of tree branches and slung it with every available
coat. Then Fielding and Harris had roughly plopped him down and
set off at a jolting trot across the beach. Part way back, they
were met by Sergeant Crocker and a search party.
<P>    She who'd fired the unlucky bullet straggled alongside, hand
clutching his arm, twittering apologies and sympathy. Little
good that did. Hard to believe she was a crack shot. Or perhaps
she'd aimed all too well.
<P>    Montague was her name. Monty, in moments of endearment. They
all assumed she was a well-bred Englishwoman, stranded in
America. But appearances could be deceiving. He'd been shocked
out of his mind at the sight of those splendid white thighs
exposed to the touch of another man. This, even though they'd
not been exposed to him for some time now. She'd obviously never
imagined he'd monitor her little charade that closely.
<P>    He lay by the fire, waiting for them to make up their minds
what to do next. His shoulder and breast began to throb with
stabs that extended up the back of his neck and down to his
hips. Waves of raw sensation made him twist his body to relieve
the discomfort. In between the crests of pain, a growing chill,
a clammy other-worldliness and a curious sense of detachment.
Then the pain would start again, and he'd grit his teeth and
turn this way and that, cautiously shifting limbs to find
relief.
<P>    The circle of earnest faces round the campfire peered at him
while Montague mopped the sweat off his brow and adjusted
blankets against the cool night air. Sergeant Crocker and
Captain Ames in turn slid back the covers to inspect the wound,
then retired to the ring of solemn spectators, muttering
pessimistic diagnoses that he overheard all too well. Maidstone
should have been the one pronouncing on the ills of the world.
Now he barely had the strength to comment on his own. 
<P>    Crocker began to recount the evening's events in the tones
of one accustomed to dealing with the niggling questions of
superior officers.
<P>    "We was beginning to wonder what'd become of Mrs. Maidstone,
Captain. So I ups and fetches a lantern and we sets off down the
shore a piece, figuring we'd 'elp 'er carry in 'er things, like.
We 'ears this shot ring out, echoing from every direction. So we
blunders along, 'eading for the sound of the shot, best we could
tell. An' Frenchie over there ... What's 'is name? Latour." He
indicated the campfire of the canoemen down the beach. "'E comes
pounding out of the dark, full tilt into me belt buckle.
'Sergeant,' says 'e, 'Mr. Maidstone, 'e's been shot.' We follows
in the direction pointed out, and soon enough, we comes up with
Mr. 'Arris and Mr. Fielding bringing in Mr. Maidstone on a
h'improvised stretcher."
<P>    The subject of this account was nearly overwhelmed by a
fresh tide of pain, anger, and nausea as he listened to Sergeant
Crocker recount the irrelevant details. He raised his head and
opened his mouth to supply the missing context, pointing
accusingly at the wrongdoer with his good arm. But his gorge
rose faster than his ire and he fell back swallowing hard to
maintain intestinal equilibrium. Captain Ames spoke from beyond
the fire.
<P>    "Harris, Fielding, did either of you witness this singular
event?"
<P>    Harris cleared his throat. "Yes, sir. Just before sundown, I
happened to be inspecting the surrounding hills with my
spyglass. Watching for signs of animal life more than anything.
Up on the heights at the back of this inlet, Mr. Maidstone was
briefly visible through a break in the trees. I concluded he
must be out for a stroll. Perhaps with the intention of joining
Mrs. Maidstone at the beach which lies to the south of here.
Somewhat after sundown, I noticed that neither of them had come
in. So I went out to offer my services. ... Er, should the lady
have missed her husband in the dark and require assistance
getting in her sketching things." All eyes were on Harris.
<P>    "Just as I neared the beach, a shot rang out and something
galloped past me in the dark. At the time, I thought it was a
wild animal ... Ensign Fielding did grapple with something, sir.
And he received severe bruises to show for it. ... Then I found
Mr. Maidstone lying wounded, with a discharged revolver on the
sand nearby. I take it he'd given the weapon to his wife for her
protection. He must have tried to face the intruder armed only
with his knife. In the confusion, she fired, and the shot must
have gone astray. I ... we arrived just in time to bring them to
safety."
<P>    "Splendid, Harris. And you Fielding, d'you think this
intruder was a wild animal?"
<P>    "Human, sir."
<P>    "The details, man. Did you get a good look at him?"
<P>    "No, sir, but from the way he fought, ... he must've had
the very <I>devil</I> on his back."
<P>    Beside the fire, the injured man started to protest, but
only succeeded in stifling a groan. He was beginning to realize
that a direct accusation would hurt him as much as Fielding.
Captain Ames approached, radiating solicitude.
<P>    "Is that substantially what happened, Maidstone?"
<P>    Eyes opened briefly in the pale, sweat-streaked face. Teeth
were gritted in what Ames took to be the semblance of a brave
smile. He murmured something incoherent and appeared to nod in
assent as his head lolled back and forth in reaction to yet
another spike of pain. He no longer possessed the strength or
the clarity of mind to pursue vengeful goals. Sensing he was on
the downward slide, he merely hoped that someone, anyone, could
relieve his suffering. 
<P>    Captain Ames turned to the lady. "My <I>dear</I> Mrs. Maidstone,
allow me to congratulate you on your lucky escape." He bent down
to pat her hands where she sat staring forlornly into the fire.
"I shall place at your disposal our entire resources to ward off
any further threat."  He turned and began to issue orders.
"Crocker, establish a picket. See the camp is well secured
against any intruder still lurking in the bushes."
<P>    Crocker went off to organize the men. Guns were loaded and
priming checked. Every face turned outward to the wooded
perimeter of the beach, searching for the tell-tale reflection
of firelight on hostile eyes. The injured man's own eyes opened
a slit. What the devil were they watching for? He was the one
who needed attention. 
<P>    A groan from Maidstone brought all eyes inward again. "Ames,
for God's sake ... do something ... remove the ball ... stop
the bleeding." It took all his energy to form the words and he
sank back exhausted.
<P>    "Quite right, old man, quite right." The Captain peered into
the tortured face. Aside, he added, "Not a doctor within a
hundred miles. Have to make the best of it. Harris, scour the
camp. Interrogate the canoemen. Find out if anyone has the
slightest knowledge of surgery."
<P>    Who could he depend on? Maidstone looked up at Captain Ames,
white hair tumbling over broad forehead, a kindly but witless
man: terminally ineffectual. The others?  Crocker: hearty
but ignorant. Harris: too devious by far.  Fielding: eager
young Romeo, probably thirsting for revenge.  He should be the
one lying here, oozing out his heart's blood. Or other fluids of
an intimate nature.
<P>    Harris returned with his report. "No one, sir. Not a
particle of surgery in the lot. ... However," and now he shoved
Fielding to the fore, "one, at least, has a modicum of
veterinary experience." 
<P>    Captain Ames pressed Fielding's arm in his most
elder-statesmanly way. "We must act immediately, my boy. He'll
not reach Fort William in this condition. What do you know of
surgery?" 
<P>    Fielding turned pale. "What? Me, sir? Very little. ... Er,
I once assisted my father's mare to foal. Patched up a pet
animal or two back in Kingston. I'm sure you'd find the details
most distasteful." 
<P>    "Nonsense, out with it, distasteful or not."
<P>    "Very good, sir, if you insist. But the truth is, I only
casually mentioned the story to Harris. It was never meant as
a recital of my qualifications. ... The story of my pet rooster,
that is."
<P>    "Go on."
<P>    "Well, I, er, fixed him up when he got run over by a
farmer's wagon. I was three years younger then, and at the time,
it certainly <I>felt</I> like a life-and-death responsibility. The
smallest details have stuck in my mind. ... " James stared at
Maidstone as he said this. "... I can even remember how very
<I>much</I> I would have enjoyed doing surgery on the damnable
smirking fool who did it.  ... I beg your pardon, sir. Do you
really think this is relevant?"
<P>    "We <I>have</I> to know precisely what you can do," said the
Captain. "You may be the man's last hope." Fielding dug his toe
into the sand, casting more glances at Maidstone.
<P>    "Very well then. ... When I picked him up, I could see he
was pretty badly smashed. His guts were all squashed out and one
leg was crushed. I figured he was done for anyway. So I simply
did my best to patch him up. Washed off the dirt, packed the
guts back inside, pulled the edges together with a needle and
thread. Doused the wound with whiskey. Had to hack off his
crushed leg with a fret-saw. Cauterized the stump with a candle.
Poor fellow just opened and shut his beak all the while.
<P>    "Hopped round on one leg chasing hens for a year or more
after the operation. Next thing to a miracle, so far as I could
see. Then one afternoon the preacher came by for a visit. Said
I'd crossed the will of God by not letting him die. Well, I
wasn't having any of that, so I skipped out to call on my chums
-- even though the preacher had brought his daughter along."
<P>    Here Fielding smiled a little fatuously. "You see, my mother
and the Reverend Dinsmore were doing their best to get something
started between me and Violet ..." Harris caught his eye and
discreetly shook his head.
<P>    Back on topic, Fielding put on a sadder look. "Yes, well ...
In any case, I came back too late. There was the preacher and
the rest of them sitting down to supper -- roast cockerel with
only one drumstick. But old Chanticleer got the final revenge.
His flesh was too tough to eat and they had to make do with
potatoes and gravy. And while Mum was serving tea, Dad sent me
out to bury the carcass in the garden, discreet like."
<P>    A fresh spasm pierced Maidstone's breast. His eyes sprang
wide and he saw Captain Ames looking appalled with the rest. His
pain-fogged perceptions went tack-sharp as all eyes switched
from Fielding to him. A horrid prospect began to emerge. The
diffuse ache that had ebbed and flowed, leaving him briefly at
peace, was now replaced by the strident calls of every nerve in
the vicinity of the wound, each clamouring its message of
torment. A glum Fielding stared at him as Captain Ames gave
final sanction.
<P>    "You must do the best you can, James. And I will assist
in my way. The copy of scripture I loaned you, do you have
it handy?" 
<P>    Harris interjected. "I-I-I think it was left on a rock, back
at the scene of the 'accident', sir. We'll be sure to fetch it
in the morning."
<P>    Fielding still seemed uncertain, composing himself for
impossible responsibility.  "If I <I>must</I> attempt it, sir, I'll
need clean linen for bandages, whiskey to bathe the wound,
something long, narrow and sharp to probe with. ... And Sergeant
Crocker and a couple of men to hold him down."
<P>    As the requested items were assembled, Maidstone looked up
at his surgeon, assessing his chances of survival.  Here was the
lad he'd been exchanged for in that absurd deal on Lake Ontario
between Captain Fielding and Colonel Enright. His own worth had
come out on the wrong side of the scales, short of Fielding's by
a cask of Madeira. The Colonel's sense of humour wore thin
at times.
<P>    And in Montreal, he'd had the bad luck to be recognised by
none other. He wondered if Fielding had been deceived at the
<I>soiree</I> when he'd huffed and puffed a case of mistaken
identity. Probably not. Monty had been a lucky distraction, a
baited lure he might troll in murky waters. She was enough to
turn any man's head from duty. Even, at times, his own.
<P>    His duty, as he saw it, was to bring enlightenment to this
remnant of stiff-necked, colonial Englishmen. The right to
pursue life, liberty and happiness, whether they liked it or
not. As a step in this direction he'd simply wanted to clarify
the agenda of Ames' survey party. To prevent any interference
with Colonel Enright's frontier expedition. American citizens
had a perfect right to explore the western territories of their
own continent, without British supervision. But then, he'd
gotten wind of Admiral Fisher's schemes. Information had grown
more costly, calling for increasingly desperate measures. Such
as hiring waterfront thugs to pitch knives at Fisher's errand
boys and bribing regimental adjutants.
<P>    He'd developed the scheme of playing on Fielding's weakness
for mature womanhood. This ought to have fished-up the desired
information. Plus the added bonus of a cadet officer's disgrace,
to delay and discredit a project that showed every sign of being
ill-conceived from the outset. Unfortunately, the lady had taken
her instructions too much to heart. And now she tried to atone
by mopping his brow for the hundredth time. He smiled weakly at
this lovely betrayer. Drained of venom, he was feebly grateful
for the solace she offered. And Fielding, now staring at him
like a dull-witted mechanic. The tinker who mended pet animals
was assembling his instruments to probe the wounds of a hero
-- or a martyr. 
<P>    Montague knelt beside him in the firelight. She and Fielding
peeled off his blood-soaked shirt and exposed the wound.
Fielding looked at him meaningfully and flexed his fingers.
<P>    "I must have something to insert in the wound."
<P>    With an audible smack, she placed the knife smartly on his
hand. He tested its sharpness against his thumb. Maidstone
recognised his own weapon, the very steel he'd wielded in his
recent attempt to unman his surgeon.
<P>    "Hmmm. This blade is much too broad."
<P>    "I'll fetch a hatpin and some eye-brow tweezers from my
reticule." Montague departed and soon returned with a selection
of the tools of her womanly craft.
<P>    Maidstone followed the proceedings out of the corner of his
eye as his surgeon placed the points of an assortment of sharp
instruments in a pan of spirits and then turned to consider the
patient. The projectile had entered his breast in an upward and
cross-wise direction. A flow of blood still oozed from the wound
and ran down his chest. He sensed that the ball must be
unreachable, because the pain seemed to radiate from deep, deep
within, spreading out in fiery waves.
<P>    Fielding wiped off clotted blood with a piece of damp linen
and poked with a tentative finger. He appeared to remember
something and dabbled his hands in the whiskey. Maidstone felt
cold digits probing past the mouth of the wound and stealing
across his chest into his armpit. A sudden, white-hot flash as
they reached a spot that glowed with pain. He raved curses at
his tormentor.
<P>    The surgeon seemed to have made up his mind. "Crocker, have
your men ready to hold him down. First, give him whiskey, plenty
of it."
<P>    The men plied him with whiskey, loutishly grinning and
nudging each other. He felt only too ready to cooperate and
gulped the raw spirits down, knowing full well what horrors were
in store.
<P>    The whiskey began to take effect and Fielding again motioned
to Sergeant Crocker and his men. They positioned themselves on
either hand, while Montague remained beside the bandages and
instruments. Through bleary eyes, he saw Fielding bend close and
speak to him.
<P>    "If the ball is too deep, I'll do nothing. We'll try to get
you through to Fort William, do you understand?" Breathing
heavily through clenched teeth, he blinked his eyes in token
agreement. 
<P>    Fielding kept up a steady commentary for those spectators
with stomach enough to watch. To Maidstone's whiskey-soaked
mind, the voice began to sound more and more distant ... and,
oddly enough, more and more benign.
<P>    "The ball has gone completely through the breast muscle.
Probably broken a few ribs. Looks like it's travelled right up
under his arm somewhere. Note the discolourations in its path."
Maidstone felt a finger lightly tracing the ball's route. "I'll
see if I can reach it by probing the wound. Hold him well,
Sergeant."
<P>    A thick wad of linen was inserted between his teeth and tied
in place. Rough hands pressed him down against the sand.
<P>    Fielding gradually inserted Montague's hatpin into the
wound. Maidstone arched his body and gave a loud grunt of pain
through his nose. The implement was promptly withdrawn, despite
the assurance of Sergeant Crocker:
<P>    "We can 'old 'im, sir." 
<P>    "It's too pointed," said Fielding. "I thought the ball would
make a clean opening, but it's closed up again. His lung is
intact. You see here, round his mouth and nose, no froth. I
don't want to puncture it by accident. And besides, I can't
simply <I>spear</I> the ball and pull it out."
<P>    Maidstone heard these words with the curious feeling they
concerned someone else. The lips of his surgeon moved but at
first he couldn't seem to hear properly. A moment later, the
meaning would enter his head, but minus the words that conveyed
it. Without even being aware if his eyes were really open, he
seemed to perceive everything by a strange absorbtion of
sensation.
<P>    Slowly, he began to swim through a viscous sea of trivial
events, gradually drifting away from it all. The wise, fatherly
voice of his surgeon reassured him. Smiling to himself, he
chewed placidly on the gag, soaking it with his saliva. He hoped
he wouldn't be sick in the canoe and make the steersman angry.
And then there was the vexing question of how to get Monty back
east again. Now he'd have to find some way to ship her onward
from Fort William to meet Captain Loomis and the <I>Progress</I> at
the head of Lake Superior. Ah, but the <I>Progress</I> was back on
Lake Huron ...
<P>    "Hand me those pincers," said a voice.
<P>    A pair of hands inserted the hatpin between the jaws and
thrust it toward the fire. Its point glowing, the pin was
withdrawn from the coals and grasped by the glass bead that
formed its head. The pincers bent the point in a circle, turned
slightly upward like a miniature spoon. He heard a faint sizzle
as the tip was quenched in the spirits. Then the hands
approached the mouth of the wound with this curious new
implement. 
<P>    The curved point went in easily and he felt only a little
pain. In fact, the procedure was mildly interesting, in an
academic sort of way. The instrument worked its way past the
torn tissues till he imagined it at least a handspan inside his
body. All round the fringes of his being, disembodied arms
pressed him down, preventing him from floating away. Then the
probe met a rigid obstacle. He could feel it tapping against
something deep within his chest. 
<P>    "It's no good. I think I can touch it, but the hatpin isn't
quite long enough," said a voice, rising in pitch. "Maybe I
should leave the ball in him. It could do more harm than good
trying to get it out." 
<P>    Another voice, older and more insistent: "Begging your
pardon, sir, but you <I>must</I> get it out. It's the lead in the
ball, sir. It'll poison 'im." 
<P>    "Are you positive?" said the youthful voice. "I thought that
was a myth."
<P>    "I've seen plenty of men die in my time," said the older
voice, "and plenty as waited too long to 'ave the shot taken out
of 'em. You've <I>got</I> to do it, sir."
<P>    The voices argued interminably, diminishing in volume as he
floated slowly away, bored by the tedious unravelling of his own
fate. 
<P>
<P>    James stared at the unconscious man, his feeling of
helplessness growing.
<P>    "Sir, I think he's gone under at last," reported Sergeant
Crocker. 
<P>    They turned Maidstone on his side. Abandoning the frontal
approach, James now tried to locate the place where the ball
would have exited, had it possessed the energy of a few more
grains of gunpowder.  That point was marked by a distinct black
bruise beneath the skin of the victim's back. He pinched the
flesh and felt a curious solidity, a hard lump which he tried to
isolate between thumb and forefinger. Maidstone stirred
slightly.
<P>    "Hold him, Crocker." He worked the lump against the
blackened skin with as much force as he dared. 
<P>    "Lord save 'im, sir, that must be the ball. It ain't but a
finger's breadth below the skin."
<P>    For the second time James accepted the assassin's dagger
from Mrs. Maidstone's outstretched hand. Maintaining his pinch
on the flesh-encased ball, he drew the blade smoothly across the
fold of skin. Maidstone stirred again and hummed softly into his
linen gag as a new spurt of blood started down his back.
<P>    "Whiskey, pour on whiskey. Wash off the blood," directed
James.
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone poured whiskey over the fold of skin that
James still pinched. Inside the sharp edges of the cut was
revealed a pulpy mass of torn flesh, and ...
<P>    "There it is," she exulted. "You've found the ball."
<P>    Before the blood could well up again, James extricated the
projectile with the point of the knife. He flicked it away where
it fell with a clang into the pan of spirits. Maidstone
continued to breathe steadily.
<P>    "He's clean out of it," noted Sergeant Crocker.
<P>    The Sergeant and his men tidied Maidstone up and applied new
bandages as neatly as they could.  James tottered over to the
fireside to sit in silence beside Harris.  They watched Mrs.
Maidstone lay blankets over the unconscious man, his gag now
removed, so he could sleep off the worst of the whiskey and
veterinary surgery.
<P>    James sat with his head in his hands. Mrs. Maidstone stole
over to his side carrying the half-empty whiskey bottle and
touched his shoulder. He glanced up into her liquid, grey-green
eyes. Reflected in the firelight, he thought he could see in
them, as he felt in himself, the relief of one who has shared --
and survived -- some desperate enterprise. But it was also the
look of one who has learned too much about the other ever to
feel again the sweet pangs of first love.
<P>    "He'll have a head on 'im tomorrow, ma'am, mark my words,"
said the Sergeant, dropping bloodsoaked scraps of bandage on
the flames.
<P>    Mrs. Maidstone handed James the bottle. "And you too, Mr.
Fielding, but with a sweeter wakening."
<P>    Returning to keep vigil beside Maidstone, she stared upward
at the night sky, as he'd seen her do earlier that evening.
James took a hefty swig of whiskey, choked down the murderous
draught, then lay back slowly on the sand beside Harris.

<A NAME="tasks"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/tasks.jpeg">
<I>tasks </I> - <B>The Tasks of Eve.</B>

This slide collection was inspired by an "invitational" art show, in the
Niagara area, that was announced about the time of Derek's drawing course
with Linda Hankin. The title was something like: Women's Work. But on closer
review, the specifications called for a single painting or drawing. So this
project, being a series of photographs, had to find another audience. Hi
there, audience.


<A NAME="3001-ev1"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/3001/3001-ev1.jpeg">
<I>3001-ev1 </I> - <B>Stamping out paternalistic myths.</B>

The problems of our modern Eve began way back, in the Garden of Eden, when
her predecessor got some bad advice.

<A NAME="1131-21b"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1131-21b.jpeg">
<I>1131-21b </I> - <B>Resisting the claims of authority.</B>

A few of these problems, I must admit, have been handed down to us by the
laying on of masculine hands from one generation to the next.

<A NAME="1132-11b"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1132-11b.jpeg">
<I>1132-11b </I> - <B>No salvation through public works.</B>

But some of Eve's present day concerns have more to do with the laying
on of steel and concrete, as if an overwhelming investment in infrastructure
and technology could create the earthly paradise.

<A NAME="1140-04"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/114/1140-04.jpeg">
<I>1140-04 </I> - <B>Becoming assertive - No means No!</B>

In fact, there are still quite a few antediluvian aspects of human nature that
need to be explicitly challenged and fenced about ...

<A NAME="1132-14a"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1132-14a.jpeg">
<I>1132-14a </I> - <B>Coping with the dark night of the soul.</B>

Lest she might sink in despair at the dark broodings she faces, the complex
obscurity of the task, and the uncertain prospects ahead.

<A NAME="1130-26b"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1130-26b.jpeg">
<I>1130-26b </I> - <B>Supporting the arts during cutbacks.</B>

But to refine and illuminate the parable, our modern Eve will emerge from
private musings, not shunning the light of public debate, to plead her
case with contemporary opinion.

<A NAME="1143-23b"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/114/1143-23b.jpeg">
<I>1143-23b </I> - <B>Promoting the greening of heavy industry.</B>

Her focus will be not only personal. She must actively encourage
institutional, even industrial rectitude.

<A NAME="1134-20"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1134-20.jpeg">
<I>1134-20 </I> - <B>Taming the savage beast.</B>

There are those, modern purveyors of bread and circuses, who hide behind the
masks of levity, but who wield enormous influence in shaping the ideas of a
generation.

<A NAME="1130-10"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1130-10.jpeg">
<I>1130-10 </I> - <B>Levitating offspring.</B>

A generation all too easily lost within structures that appear to cater to
every whim and desire, but which, in the final analysis, provide very little
comfort and support for the developing spirit.

<A NAME="1139-16"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1139-16.jpeg">
<I>1139-16 </I> - <B>Monitoring genetic experimentation.</B>

The planet can undoubtedly become more productive, but Eve's challenge is to
critique that restless urge to tamper with the tried and true, which can in
extreme cases hazard the genetic heritage that has taken millenia to evolve.

<A NAME="1136-19a"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1136-19a.jpeg">
<I>1136-19a </I> - <B>Finding the devil in the details.</B>

The thorn in the rose, the seed in the grape, the Tilley hat -- these are
problems not worth solving, when compared to the rich fertility of human
scheming, the intricate aggravations of communal life in the global city.

<A NAME="1132-09a"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1132-09a.jpeg">
<I>1132-09a </I> - <B>Taking time out to be alone.</B>

Periodically, Eve must seek out refreshment from the tedious round. But it
would be pointless to crawl away to some isolated sanctuary, insulated though
this might be from the world of futile striving.

<A NAME="1137-25"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1137-25.jpeg">
<I>1137-25 </I> - <B>Cultivating the inner Woman of Mystery.</B>

Instead, she'll seek inner rest and rectitude through a realignment of self
with the timeless rhythms of an eternal order of things.

<A NAME="1132-07a"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1132-07a.jpeg">
<I>1132-07a </I> - <B>Facing challenges in academic life.</B>

And emerge refreshed, ready to face the manifest absurdity of organized
existence, and cheerfully to recognise many of the blocked avenues of life for
what they are. False portals only leading to corridors that conduct the
wayfarer even deeper into the morass.

<A NAME="3001-03"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/3001/3001-03.jpeg">
<I>3001-03 </I> - <B>Building the New Jerusalem.</B>

I see her, in the sunny uplands of life, on the ramparts, smiling an ironic
little smile, assembling the means to either build or hurl down.

<A NAME="1132-18"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1132-18.jpeg">
<I>1132-18 </I> - <B>Reviewin' the troops, boostin' morale.</B>

There are those, Eve, who stand ready. Ready, aye, ready, to assist in the
construction of the new order, or in the deconstruction of the old.

<A NAME="1139-22"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1139-22.jpeg">
<I>1139-22 </I> - <B>Sticking to the plan.</B>

But we rely on you to chart a course for the future.

<A NAME="1138-11"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1138-11.jpeg">
<I>1138-11 </I> - <B>Achieving mystical serenity.</B>

A future wherein we may also attain some approximation of your reconciliation
to the human condition. Not, that is, by mastery over mere circumstance,
something that we can never fully achieve, since we ourselves are creatures of
circumstance ...

<A NAME="1138-15a"><BR clear='all'><BR><IMG ALIGN='left' SRC="./DR/GRA1/113/1138-15a.jpeg">
<I>1138-15a </I> - <B>Gathering flowers while she may.</B>

But by willing immersion in that order of things in which we all live and move
and have our being.

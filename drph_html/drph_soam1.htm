<BR><P><B>June 4-5 Quito, Ecuador</B>

<I>D224-006 09-06-05</I> - <B>Quito arrival, surrounded by mountains.</B><xxx>

<BR> This view from our hotel room, greeted us the morning after arrival in
Quito, Ecuador. We're impressed by the city's location with mountains on all
sides. Contrary to richer cities, the low-rent districts are often higher up
the mountainsides, with a better view.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-008.jpeg">
<I>D224-008 09-06-05</I> - <B>Hotel Dann Carlton, Quito.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Dann Carlton is a medium-sized hotel. Owned by a Senora Spivak. A
Columbian, we're told. Merle once knew a Spivak family in Toronto. The hotel
is named after one of the tribes of Israel.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-007.jpeg">
<I>D224-007 09-06-05</I> - <B>A major Ecuadorean export, roses.</B><xxx>

<BR> Reproduction period furniture in the lobby. Plenty of English speakers on
staff. Fresh roses, in large displays. Roses are a major Ecuadorean export,
shipped all over the world by air. Russians prefer the long-stemmed variety.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-010.jpeg">
<I>D224-010 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Not much scent. Too bad. Or would that lead to sensory overkill with so
many clustered together?
<P><B>June 5 Flight Quito-San Christobal Is.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-012.jpeg">
<I>D224-012 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> We catch our plane for the Galapagos at Quito airport.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-014.jpeg">
<I>D224-014 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> "TAME" airlines as opposed to "WILD" airlines? Reminds us of Hamilton, Mount
Hope airport. The outdoor entry to the airplane, up a stairway humanizes
aviation, but needs good weather.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-023.jpeg">
<I>D224-023 09-06-05</I> - <B>Quito from the air.</B><xxx>

<BR> Liftoff for the Galapagos. Our takeoff runway is to the right. Taller
buildings and hotels on the left. The football stadium, the red and green
oval, bottom left.

<BR><P><B>San Christobal (Chatham) Is., Galapagos</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-028.jpeg">
<I>D224-028 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> An airport with landscaping and a cactus garden. Really more of a landing
strip than an air terminal. Though the Galapagos is part of Ecuador, we
proceed to yet another careful check of documents and luggage.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-031.jpeg">
<I>D224-031 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> They don't want illegal immigrants of either the human or the ecological
kind.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-033.jpeg">
<I>D224-033 09-06-05</I> - <B>Our first seal of many.</B><xxx>

<BR> We're transported by mini-bus from airport to harbour. Going have to learn
to tell the difference between seals and sea lions. Ears, says Merle.
<P><B>June 5 Transfer to MV Santa Cruz</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-035.jpeg">
<I>D224-035 09-06-05</I> - <B>Our first Zodiac jaunt of many.</B><xxx>

<BR> 10 or 15 Passengers per boatload. The town has several thousand population
but no piers for large ships. Everything has to be ferried in and out of
harbour in small boats.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-039.jpeg">
<I>D224-039 09-06-05</I> - <B>Yes, well ...</B><xxx>

<BR> Do these people look apprehensive, or eager? The dark, reflective sunglasses
are a good foil for the photographer. You can read anything you want into the
reflection -- your own anxiety or excitement.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-040.jpeg">
<I>D224-040 09-06-05</I> - <B>This will be ...</B><xxx>

<BR> One of the guides fills us in on a few details about our accomodation. He's
Italian-speaking and eventually leads a group from Italy.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-042.jpeg">
<I>D224-042 09-06-05</I> - <B>Your home for the next 3 nights.</B><xxx>

<BR> If this is the Santa Cruz, it looks like some of us may have to sleep on the
roof.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-043.jpeg">
<I>D224-043 09-06-05</I> - <B>Just kidding. THIS is it.</B><xxx>

<BR> THERE'S the Santa Cruz. What a relief. Looks like a crowd has already
gathered at the bar on the rear upper deck. Happy hour starts early in these
latitudes.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-044.jpeg">
<I>D224-044 09-06-05</I> - <B>The MV Santa Cruz.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz is registered in Guayaquil, 1675 gross tonnage, length 72
metres, accomodation for 90 passengers, 2 x 1620 bhp engines, cruising speed
13 knots.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-047.jpeg">
<I>D224-047 09-06-05</I> - <B>The crew welcomes us on board.</B><xxx>

<BR> 60 crew and 7 guides. Steerage class cabins are behind round ports on lower
deck. Toffs located on the deck above, away from the engine.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-048.jpeg">
<I>D224-048 09-06-05</I> - <B>Another Zodiac of tourists motors out.</B><xxx>

<BR> Looking back at Puerto Moreno, San Christobal Island.  The airport just over
the hill on the horizon. ... Is that a deckchair I see? Doesn't seem to need
rearranging though.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-051.jpeg">
<I>D224-051 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> 14 passengers, 1 crew on the last zodiac out from shore.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-052.jpeg">
<I>D224-052 09-06-05</I> - <B>Plus our luggage.</B><xxx>

<BR>  Our own bags, blue and red, are visible on the near side. The red one is
Merle's. Lucky it didn't fall overboard.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-053.jpeg">
<I>D224-053 09-06-05</I> - <B>The Zodiacs are hoisted on board.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz carries 6, plus a glass bottom boat.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-061.jpeg">
<I>D224-061 09-06-05</I> - <B>And stacked three high.</B><xxx>

<BR> The messy-looking rope skirts are to protect the boat's air-inflated
rubber hull against collisions with rocks during landings on shore.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-055.jpeg">
<I>D224-055 09-06-05</I> - <B>We head out of the anchorage.</B><xxx>

<BR> The wind is fair for France. Or, at least, for a trip down the coast
to Cerro Brujo, our afternoon destination. Meantime, a bite of lunch.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-059.jpeg">
<I>D224-059 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> This is what a 13 knot bow-wave looks like. Quite a commotion of water. The
Santa Cruz makes most of her mileage at lunch time and in the evenings. This
positions us for our morning and afternoon excursions.
<P><B>June 5, pm  Wet landing, Cerro Brujo.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-068.jpeg">
<I>D224-068 09-06-05</I> - <B>"Cormorants", ready for first landing.</B><xxx>

<BR>We're divided into groups such as "Sea Lions" and "Cormorants". Each group,
with a guide, fits into a single Zodiac. The small groups are easier for the
guide to talk to and reduce the impact on trails and beaches ashore.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-071.jpeg">
<I>D224-071 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Cerro Brujo is just down the coast from Puerto Moreno. We keep a sharp
lookout for critters as we motor shoreward. D'you think those are birds in
the right hand cave? Or merely bird-shaped rocks?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-084.jpeg">
<I>D224-084 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> A "wet landing". No pier, over the side and over our ankles. The reef
offshore moderates the larger breakers, so the zodiac is stable. Wow, strange
island in the offing.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-102.jpeg">
<I>D224-102 09-06-05</I> - <B>"Kicker Rock".</B><xxx>

<BR> Looks like a boot. But the kick would have to be backward, with the heel. A
volcanic vestige, eroding in the sea. We're at the older, eastern side of the
archipelago.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-088.jpeg">
<I>D224-088 09-06-05</I> - <B>A trek to the beach.</B><xxx>

<BR> From the zodiac landing area to the swimming beach. The first boatload
already exploring water and shore. This is the 1st island Darwin visited. He
slept on shore and marvelled at the volcanic cones inland.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-091.jpeg">
<I>D224-091 09-06-05</I> - <B>Welcoming committee asleep.</B><xxx>

<BR> Any more relaxed and it would spread out like a puddle and
sink into the sand.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-096.jpeg">
<I>D224-096 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz has supplied us with swim fins, goggles and snorkels. The
zodiac offshore stands ready to keep an eye on the swimmers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-100a.jpeg">
<I>D224-100a 09-06-05</I> - <B>One for the Beach portfolio.</B><xxx>

<BR> This is one of the world's more idyllic beaches. No high-rise resort
hotels. No palm trees. No little thatched cabanas. No cliches.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-104.jpeg">
<I>D224-104 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> A few figures wander down at the far, southern, end of the beach. We've been
warned by the naturalist not to go farther. They don't want to have to send out
search parties or have us trampling endangered species without supervision.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-107.jpeg">
<I>D224-107 09-06-05</I> - <B>Looking back toward the landing.</B><xxx>

<BR> Looking back toward the swimming area. A seal or sea-lion
is asleep on the rocks, left.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-109a.jpeg">
<I>D224-109a 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> "Kicker Rock" again.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-110.jpeg">
<I>D224-110 09-06-05</I> - <B>Cerro Brujo.</B><xxx>

<BR> Internet translation of "Cerro Brujo" is "Wizard Hill". It has a dark,
portentous quality that certainly dominates the beach area. Other parts of
San Christobal Is. are flatter, less dramatic.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-111.jpeg">
<I>D224-111 09-06-05</I> - <B>The Santa Cruz.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz waits offshore for our return. The cooks are preparing
supper, no doubt. A low afternoon sun. It gets dark about 6:15pm at this
latitude.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-112.jpeg">
<I>D224-112 09-06-05</I> - <B>Derek savours the beachcombing life.</B><xxx>

<BR>Beach camping might be attractive. But not sure how you'd survive here, if
you really were marooned. No fresh water that we could see. No edible
vegetation or fruit. You'd have to munch critters, if you could catch them.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-117.jpeg">
<I>D224-117 09-06-05</I> - <B>Merle tries snorkeling.</B><xxx>

<BR> Gear supplied by the Santa Cruz from lockers on the upper deck. Every size
flipper was available up to 13 for Derek.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-119.jpeg">
<I>D224-119 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Merle, see any jetsam, flotsam, fish, turtles? Pieces of eight? Dubloons?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-121.jpeg">
<I>D224-121 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Derek is unable to use the snorkel because his eyglasses won't fit inside.
Being nearsighted underwater is even more useless than being nearsighted on
land..
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-123.jpeg">
<I>D224-123 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-126.jpeg">
<I>D224-126 09-06-05</I> - <B>Merle and her (his) shadow.</B><xxx>

<BR> On a relentless quest for photo-ops, Derek picks out a damsel who is
definitely NOT in distress. He guesses that she's in her natural element.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-136.jpeg">
<I>D224-136 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> He wants to get a series for his "Life is a Beach" portfolio.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-142.jpeg">
<I>D224-142 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The sand is so fine it mixes even with small waves. Almost a slurry of sand,
water and bubbles.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-143.jpeg">
<I>D224-143 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Waves going out.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-144.jpeg">
<I>D224-144 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Meet the next waves coming in.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-145.jpeg">
<I>D224-145 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-146.jpeg">
<I>D224-146 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Briefly smooth again.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-147.jpeg">
<I>D224-147 09-06-05</I> - <B>Shadows lengthen.</B><xxx>

<BR> Moon-rise over this wind-blown dune, back of the beach, reminds us that the
afternoon's excursion is nearly over.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-148.jpeg">
<I>D224-148 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Time to gather our flippers, snorkels and damp towels and head back to the
zodiac landing.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-150.jpeg">
<I>D224-150 09-06-05</I> - <B>Back to the Santa Cruz.</B><xxx>

<BR> A fast ride back. And noisy. Climbing up the gangway of the Santa Cruz, we
have our feet hosed down so we don't bring beach sand on board. Partly for
ecological reasons, partly to keep sediment out of the ship's drains.
<P><B>June 6, am  Espanola (Hood) Is.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-155.jpeg">
<I>D224-155 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The zodiacs are lowered for another excursion. We're stationed off Punta
Suarez, Espanola Island. The 1st island Darwin set eyes on. He didn't land.
But Captain Fitzroy of the Beagle send out a boat to explore the shoreline.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-157.jpeg">
<I>D224-157 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Other tourists are already on the point. The waves are bigger today. But
you don't feel them much on the open water. Nearing shore the shelving bottom
lifts the water more dramatically.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-158.jpeg">
<I>D224-158 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Glimpses of plentiful animal life among the rocks: crabs and iguanas.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-160.jpeg">
<I>D224-160 09-06-06</I> - <B>Today, a dry landing.</B><xxx>

<BR> Here you see why a zodiac needs those rope blankets on the
bow. The driver holds it onto the pier with the engine running. The bow
takes a steady grinding from the rocks and concrete.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-163.jpeg">
<I>D224-163 09-06-06</I> - <B>Marine iguanas match the rocks.</B><xxx>

<BR> Why the iguanas should have evolved an almost chameleon-like match to the
rocks is unclear. No serious predation here except for the more vulnerable
babies.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-164.jpeg">
<I>D224-164 09-06-06</I> - <B>Don't step on somebody's tail.</B><xxx>

<BR> Do they cuddle together for warmth, companionship, or are they
just oblivious to each other?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-168.jpeg">
<I>D224-168 09-06-06</I> - <B>Assertive sea lion. The "Beachmaster".</B><xxx>

<BR> One of our "Cormorants" attempted a close-up picture. They got rushed and
barked at. But keep 10 ft away and they ignore you.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-171.jpeg">
<I>D224-171 09-06-06</I> - <B>Blue-footed boobies.</B><xxx>

<BR> These two Blue-footed Boobies are clearly up to something. They have
ritualized movements, almost a kind of dance.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-172.jpeg">
<I>D224-172 09-06-06</I> - <B>Friendly, curious.</B><xxx>

<BR> They notice the tourists. It almost seems as if they're performing for
our benefit.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-174.jpeg">
<I>D224-174 09-06-06</I> - <B>A display for the tourists.</B><xxx>

<BR> Say, nice wing feathers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-176.jpeg">
<I>D224-176 09-06-06</I> - <B>Oh-oh, mating ritual starting up.</B><xxx>

<BR> The two at bottom go into their dance of love. The third one at top was
trying to get the female's attention, but, sadly, was ignored.
<BR><P><B>June 6, am  Espanola (Hood) Is.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-179.jpeg">
<I>D224-179 09-06-06</I> - <B>Marine iguanas.</B><xxx>

<BR> They seem to be basking on the sand. Get up sluggards. Whatever happened to
"Nature, red in tooth and claw?" Maybe iguanas simply groove on tropic
beaches, just like some snow-bird travellers I could name.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-180.jpeg">
<I>D224-180 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Seems like beauty is in the eye of the beholden. I'm beholden to
you, Merle, for bringing me to this place.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-181.jpeg">
<I>D224-181 09-06-06</I> - <B>Not a land iguana?</B><xxx>

<BR> Probably the Espanola Lava Lizard according to the Metropolitan
Touring guidebook, p37. The travel literature provided by this company is
outstanding. And written in good English too.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-184.jpeg">
<I>D224-184 09-06-06</I> - <B>Marine iguanas.</B><xxx>

<BR> I can't believe that this kind of cosy pile-up can be explained by anything
other than fellow-feeling. To us they seem so ugly, we can hardly believe
they might be capable of mutual toleration, or even affection.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-185.jpeg">
<I>D224-185 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The white patches are probably salt-encrusted moulting skin. Each time they
emerge from the ocean, water evaporates, leaving behind salt crystals.
Another reason why they often seem to have a white cap is that they have a
way of purging excess salt from their systems by sneezing it out of their
nostrils.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-187.jpeg">
<I>D224-187 09-06-06</I> - <B>Staying near the water for foraging.</B><xxx>

<BR> They feed on weed in the shallows near shore. The rest of the time is spent
resting or ... you know. But we didn't see any of that kind of behaviour.
Odd. What else is there to do in paradise?

<BR>  A Masked Booby perhaps?

<I>D224-195 09-06-06</I> - <B>Sea lion, bottom right.</B><xxx>

<BR> We follow a nature trail along the shoreline cliff. 10 to 15ft above the
water, but occasionally cooled by mist from breaking waves.

<I>D224-198 09-06-06</I> - <B>The white cliffs of Hood Is.</B><xxx>

<BR> We know why the white cliffs of the Galapagos are white. In time, the
combined droppings of birds, seals, and sea-lions adds a permanent, lighter
varnish to the dark rocks.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-200.jpeg">
<I>D224-200 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The birds seem little concerned with tourists pointing cameras. However, the
guides are vigilant in keeping us on the path and in small spaced-out groups.

<I>D224-201 09-06-06</I> - <B>Just picking up a few rays.</B><xxx>

<BR> This seal Looks a little spaced out too. Or perhaps, blissed out.

<I>D224-205 09-06-06</I> - <B>Frigate bird.</B><xxx>

<BR> A Frigate bird adds a piratical touch to our "peaceful Kingdom" scene. Those
"W" profile wings and the hooked beak bode no good for eggs and small fry.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-207.jpeg">
<I>D224-207 09-06-06</I> - <B>Kayo! Masked Booby?</B><xxx>

<BR> Is there such a thing as a Grey-footed Booby?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-208.jpeg">
<I>D224-208 09-06-06</I> - <B>Albatross, incubating.</B><xxx>

<BR> The path leads to a major Albatross nesing area. Birds lay a single
egg on the ground and incubate it on the spot. No nest-building. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-209.jpeg">
<I>D224-209 09-06-06</I> - <B>Why does the albatross cross the road?</B><xxx>

<BR> We're cautioned by our guide to wait till the traffic signal turns green.
Meanwhile the albatross has right of way. It proceeds with quiet dignity to
cross the hiking path.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-210.jpeg">
<I>D224-210 09-06-06</I> - <B>To get to its mate, silly.</B><xxx>

<BR> Such a sound of bills clacking. I'm told each pair has a joyous reunion here
after months at sea.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-211.jpeg">
<I>D224-211 09-06-06</I> - <B>This is not an albatross duel...</B><xxx>

<BR> Espanola Island is said to be home base to 30,000 birds.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-212.jpeg">
<I>D224-212 09-06-06</I> - <B>but a courtship dance.</B><xxx>

<BR> The birds are taking-off and whistling in for a landing so frequently the
guide calls it: Albatross International Airport. We hikers have to stay off
the flight path.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-213.jpeg">
<I>D224-213 09-06-06</I> - <B>These birds mate for life.</B><xxx>

<BR> Patiently sitting on an egg.

<BR> Impurturbable.

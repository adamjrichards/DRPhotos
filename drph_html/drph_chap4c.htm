<P>    Catherine Montague sat on a driftwood log tracing a pattern
in the sand. Its surface had that firm, even texture of beaches
rarely trodden by the foot of man (or woman), a most inviting
medium to the pensive artist. She sketched the outline of a
twisted cedar root that lay nearby. This bleached skeleton was
all that remained of a tree that had once gone to extraordinary
lengths to maintain its hold on some inhospitable piece of
ground. She drew it planted again and sending out new branches. 
<P>    Nearby sat her consort, leaning against a log and watching
the camp's preparations for the evening meal. She left off vague
imaginings and began to watch him, even as he watched the
others. Maidstone was the latest name he gave; his profession,
"optical merchant". In reality, he was an obscure New York actor
who'd protected her when she was stranded penniless by the
war.
<P>    A quietly fierce man, he was voluble only in the society of
his political associates and noteworthy theatre patrons. Forever
striving for recognition on the fringes of some larger-than-life
theatre of power and influence, he would try to become whatever
character the dramatist required.
<P>    She owed him a great deal, but what she'd given, she'd given
willingly. Between them they still shared something of that
desperate loyalty of confederates who have strengthened each
other in adversity.
<P>    His schemes were familiar enough to her, yet she was no
longer able to imagine his inner thoughts. On the few occasions
when she'd felt the approach of mutual revelation, those fierce
eyes would burn, the hard lips would part. But only the words of
the script would come out. How she longed for him to reveal
himself, to make a slip and forget his lines, blurt out some
true expression of the heart's desire. But she knew from his
increasingly frequent sarcasm that anger lay none too deeply
concealed. That he nurtured a growing sense of wrong. Too long
had he waited for recognition. The world stood on its head,
needing to be righted, by him, and she must be his accomplice.
<P>    But the accomplice had ideas of her own. She'd thwarted his
plan to ship her safely back east with Captain Loomis. Now
Maidstone was wary of her, and resentful at having to play
nursemaid to a Sunday afternoon water-colourist. Worried,
perhaps that his scheme to impress Enright and his backers might
be compromised in the ephemeral interests of Love and Art. But
he dared not risk an open rupture; she was too valuable a tool
for that. 
<P>    "You must admit, my dear," he observed, speaking softly but
without warmth, "it is most gratifying to have young Fielding
along to entertain us. A font of useful information on campcraft
and frontier lore. Gallant. And sure to gain recognition. With a
little help from us."
<P>    He turned toward her, noting the altitude of the sun. "A
hidden beach lies not far to the south of here. The setting has
considerable in its favour. I propose that you trundle your
painting things -- <I>and</I> your incomparable posterior --
thither."
<P>    Was this dig only jealousy? He'd obviously drawn his own
conclusions when she'd returned to Landry's Bay with Fielding in
tow. And did he still think they could seriously disrupt the
affairs of the British expedition through mere <I>amatory</I>
intrigue?
<P>    "Give us a farewell sketch for that doddering idiot, Ames. A
climactic sunset. Better still, a piece of improvised theatre.
Some irrefutable proof of man's frailty in the face of Nature's
awesome power. A particular man's frailty in the face of Woman's
awesome power.  But remember, my dear, <I>Art</I>, not Life." He
stood up, hauled her roughly to her feet, then dropped her hand
and sauntered off down the shore in a northerly direction.
<P>    Catherine continued to watch as he skirted a group of men
clustered round their luggage and kettles. They ignored him. He
appeared to be taking an uncharacteristic interest in natural
history today, pulling down tree branches, picking up and
examining pebbles on the beach. Her incomparable posterior,
<I>indeed</I>. She could remember moments when there had been no
irony.
<P>    She strolled back to the fireside as if to comment on
preparations for dinner. Absorbed in Bible study, James sat on a
bale of cargo away from the rest of the company. Harris busied
himself oiling a small, finely-made pistol, minutely inspecting
the lock for signs of rust. 
<P>    "Anything I can do to help?"
<P>    "The cook 'as everything well in 'and," said Sergeant
Crocker. "Thanking you anyway, Ma'am. Nothing you need soil your
delicate fingers on. 'Ere, why don't you make yourself comfortable
on 'at packing case beside Mr. Fielding and Mr. 'Arris while we
get on with it?" 
<P>    She sat down near James, who acknowledged her presence only
by glancing down at the hem of her dress, then resuming his
reading. They remained silent while the rest busied themselves
with the usual campground business. Some went to and fro for
wood, rearranged personal belongings, or bantered about the
day's events. Harris studiously ignored everyone, aiming his
empty pistol at an imaginary target and pulling the trigger with
a sharp click.
<P>    She became impatient, but kept her voice cautiously low.
"Has the Captain forbidden you to speak to me?"
<P>    "Practically." He replied without looking up.
<P>    "Am I such a dangerous creature?"
<P>    "'A beacon set up to lure men onto the shoals,' if you must
know. He gave me his Bible to read, for my moral reclamation and
the good of the expedition."  He stared fixedly at the pages of
Scripture in front of him, speaking barely above a whisper. She
had to strain to hear what he said. 
<P>    Shading her eyes, she turned with elaborate pretense to
follow a passing gull, but her voice was pitched for him alone
to hear. "A hidden beach lies south of here. Come to me at
sundown." 
<P>    "I cannot," he said in a choking voice.
<P>    "Then I shall savour the moment alone. And strive to forget
your inconstancy."
<P>    She said this aloud, jumping up and flouncing back to the
fire. There, she began to flirt outrageously with Sergeant
Crocker beside the stew kettle. James ground his teeth, snapped
the Bible shut and stalked off into the bushes, causing Harris
to start up in surprise. 
<P>    Soon tiring of Sergeant Crocker, she returned to her
luggage, selected painting things and began to amble down the
beach in the opposite direction Maidstone had taken. She
followed the demarcation line between wet and dry sand exactly,
once leaping back with a petulant "oh", as a wave threatened to
dampen her shoeleather. The men round the stewpot followed her
with sidelong glances and tolerant smiles.
<P>    At the southern end of the beach, she clambered up the
rocks, picking her way from slab to slab and making an elaborate
pretense of caution. Selecting an outlook where she was
silhouetted against the sky, she sat down and contemplated the
scene.
<P>    After an interval, she supposed the watchers back at the
camp were accustomed to her presence. Then she began a series of
small shifts in position, apparently disposing her painting
things about her, searching for the precise viewpoint that
suited her artistic purpose. As the sun neared the horizon, a
shadow fell over her vantage point. Judging from the scarcity of
turned heads, she assumed the topic of conversation on the beach
must be veering more and more toward matters of nutrition and
further away from Mrs. Maidstone and her sketching.
<P>    Leaving her painting things where they lay, Catherine edged
behind a rock and let herself down on the far side. Here she
resumed her walk over the tortuous folds of the coast toward
that hidden beach spoken of by Mr. Maidstone. It lay in a
peculiar indentation, visible to an observant eye on the water,
but hidden from the inland stroller by a trick in the lie of the
land suggesting a scratchy detour into the forest. She reached
the crescent of sand and discarded boots and stockings, then sat
down to watch the sunset. 
<P>    Information for Colonel Enright and confusion to Captain
Ames -- that was all Maidstone wanted. A simple enough plan and
she was its instrument. But what of her own desires? She thought
of her art, now prostituted to a has-been actor's wretched
search for recognition. She saw a young man sitting on a rock
doing a profile of the Georgian Bay shoreline. And somewhere to
the west, a hazy island, a mere fleck of colour at the end of
the horizon, drawing the eye ever onward.
<P>    The fiery orb descended to its inevitable quenching in the
lake. Catherine watched in fascination, attending its visible
progress, but listening hopefully for the sound of approaching
footsteps.  As the sun began its watery plunge, she hugged her
knees and turned away. The exact instant when one day died and
another was born. Was it dusk or dawn?
<P>    Behind her back, came a clattering of feet and James leapt
breathless from the rocks onto the sand. "Afraid I might ...
miss the sunset." He puffed out the phrases. "Nearly broke my
neck ... running across the stones ... difficult place to find."
<P>    "And now you want absolution, is that it? For disobeying
your superior's orders. Risking your life to do a woman's
bidding." She put on a cool smile and stretched out at full
length, leaning on one elbow and facing him. "You may approach,
young man, and sit by my side, but not too near."
<P>    He grinned in embarrassment, scanning the nearer rocks and
bushes for signs of intrusion. Then he lay down beside her on
the darkening sand and pointed out the obvious:
<P>    "Look, it's just gone down."
<P>    He continued to stare woodenly at the point where the last
sliver of light had finally winked out. A few waves lapped on the
beach. The details of his face were gradually fading.
<P>    "Gone forever?" She said this in a mock-serious tone,
waiting patiently for him to meet her eyes.
<P>    In the long silences that punctuated their conversation, her
fixed smile weakened. At times he required so much cossetting,
so much wooing to draw him out of his cocoon. ... And yet, the
man soon to emerge from within the boy gave promise of a mature
initiative, intelligence, cheerful wit, coupled with an almost
feminine reasonableness she had never before encountered in one
of his sex.
<P>    He was also, she decided, an aesthete, almost <I>erotically</I>
fascinated by the natural world, intoxicated by trees and
mountains, rapt with attention at a flower. At times, she too
would become a feature of that world. He would lavish on her an
interest equal to his passion for the lake shining through the
trees, for the high, cloud-hung ridge. Was he someone to
encourage, to <I>wait</I> for, even while she, daily, anticipated
the symptoms of middle age?
<P>    The one who'd commissioned this errand was no boyish heart.
He'd introduced her to the salons of the powerful at a time when
her own fortunes were in ruins. She moved in circles where
beauty and wit bought influence, where intrigue was an amusing
parlour game. Now she lay on a deserted strip of sand, waiting
for a tongue-tied colonial to express undying love. Maidstone
had selected a most unusual venue for a parlour game. 
<P>    James finally turned from the afterglow to look up at the
sky. He craned his head backward and then faced her at last.
<P>    "See it?" he smiled. "The evening star, or is it Aldebaran,
or Betelgueuse?" 
<P>    With her young lover at her side and back to himself at
last, Maidstone and his cold fury receded into the darkness. The
scales seemed to tilt in James' favour. Catherine wanted to
first pummel, then envelop him and keep him to herself forever.
She leaned forward and grabbed him by the ears, kissing him full
on the lips. When she'd had enough pinching and kissing, she
pressed his head down on her lap and soothed the sting with
caresses.
<P>    "Confess your inmost secrets', James. Why must Captain Ames
bind these hands when I require them round my waist?" 
<P>    He smiled in perfect trust as she ran her fingertips across
his stubbly cheek. She felt her stomach give a trickle next to
his ear, too long unfilled while she pretended to ply her art in
view of the camp stew pot. He stirred at this fresh evidence of
her corporeal nature, sighing deeply. Waiting for his answer,
she basked in a fine sense of possession, as one who has just
ventured an intimate confidence in the certainty of gaining some
reciprocal gesture.
<P>    "The Captain has his reasons. He implied that ... your
husband has made damaging accusations against me."
<P>    She inserted a finger-tip in his outer ear and began to
trace a path through the labyrinth. "And you revealed all?" 
<P>    "Damn it all, he asked me point blank if there'd been any ...
'improprieties' ... since our departure from Landry's Bay. I
<I>had</I> to tell him, no."  She could feel him flush under her
caressing hands. 
<P>    "Yes, but it <I>was</I> true, strictly speaking. The last
'impropriety' occurred <I>before</I> our departure."
<P>    Her hands ceased their wandering and came to rest folded
under his chin. That suffusion of warmth in her bosom towards
James began to dissipate a little. Men were much less exemplary
creatures the morning after, when they started worrying about
replacing the fig-leaf they'd so cheerily shucked off the
previous evening.
<P>    "He said I had to restrict my attentions to the barest
civility, for the good of the expedition."
<P>    "And what, pray tell, <I>is</I> the good of the expedition?"
<P>    She permitted herself to display sudden irritation with
Captain Ames and all his works. This by twisting a hank of his
hair till he grimaced in pain. The whole foolish parade began to
pass in front of her imagination.
<P>   "A sea captain stranded on dry land, waited on by a pack of
superannuated dragoons. And the rest of your staff -- you and
Harris and the men from the Indian Department -- forced to dance
attendance. Latrine-digging, wild sourcrout hunts,
<I>Bible-readings</I>! It's too ridiculous. Who conceived of it? Who
permitted it?"
<P>    At times she wearied at the ineptitude of youth, entangling
itself in hare-brained schemes. But was it any worse than the
well-planned disasters of maturity? She began to stroke James'
brow, as if to comfort him for the difficult situation he was
in.
<P>    "Tell me ..." She mimicked the confiding tone of a would-be
fellow-conspirator. "What is your real mission? Are you in the
pay of the Hudson's Bay Company? Sent to capture Fort William
for Lord Selkirk? The Northwest Company, to protect Fort William
from Lord Selkirk? ... Wait, I think I've guessed it. You're
being quietly shipped out to the Red River country. To bring
order to the new settlement." 
<P>    "You're not far wrong," he sighed, apparently reliving some
grave personal disappointment. "Merely to hang about and exert a
quieting influence, it seems. Originally, we were going to do
a survey all the way to the Rocky Mountains. But that's been
bogged down in politics." So far, he was only confirming what
Maidstone had already told her about the British plans.
<P>    "You mean, retrace the route of Lewis and Clark?"
<P>    "A new overland route, further north. We were supposed to
verify the exact location of the 49th parallel, the local
natural features where it intersects the Rockies. Then proceed
north in search of a usable pass." 
<P>    "But to what end? It's already been done by others."
<P>    Catherine's voice rose a little. Maidstone's quarry in view
at last. Now she was Diana the huntress again. But was the young
stag hers to topple? He sat up, shoulders sagging wearily, as he
manoevered himself into position for her killing arrow.
<P>    "The original project <I>was</I> pretty hush-hush. But I suppose
it doesn't matter much anymore. Our sponsors in the Society want
to establish a British communication corridor running across the
continent. To link up the Pacific coast with the Canadas.
Eventually create a line of quasi-military outposts across the
north-west, staffed by a sort of mounted constabulary,
or territorial light cavalry. The system would be linked by
pack-horse trails and wagon roads independent of the fur-trade
routes." It sounded to her like he was recapitulating
half-remembered phrases from some dubious promoter's prospectus.
<P>    "The 'Society'? How sinister this all sounds! I beg you, say
no more of such things. Imagine the effect on the merchants of
Council Bluff should they find British Customs and Revenue
planted on the headwaters of the Missouri. ... Who is the mad
intelligence behind this scheme?" 
<P>    "The Society for the Diffusion of Geographical Knowledge? A
gaggle of patriotic butterfly-collectors, in my opinion. Run by
a dotty old admiral, named Fisher. You must have seen him at the
<I>soiree</I>. The old boy actually keeps a Cannibal Island war club
in his drawing room. To terrify young women into submission, he
told us. ... There, satisfied yet?" Now he sounded like he was
trying to put her off with levity.
<P>    "This Admiral, has he taken you into his confidence? Will
you really go all the way to the Pacific? Which route will you
follow from the Red River? Where will you get horses? What sort
of armament does the expedition possess?"
<P>    For a brief moment, she felt she might have over-reached
with this last question. She put on her most honeyed tones.
<P>    "... Oh, dear James, I greatly fear for your safety."
<P>    But his answers on all further questions were only vague and
unsatisfactory. She lay back on the sand, one hand across her
forehead, trying to decide whether she really felt concern for
his fate or contempt at his lack of control over it.
<P>    He got up and crouched over her, straddling her body on
hands and knees. Distracted by conflicting thoughts, she nibbled
his ear while he whispered in hers.
<P>    "Why must we speak so often of official matters? I'd much
rather talk about you and me.
<P>    The broken phrases began to spill out as he dampened her
face with many kisses. "... creeping off into the bushes, like
this ... disgraced ... might share every confidence ... but dare
not speak freely ... your husband ... planning some disruption ...
but I <I>do</I> love you ...  and perhaps someday ..." 
<P>    "Maidstone is <I>not</I> my husband."
<P>    His face was inches away from hers in the pale moonrise.
Catherine held her breath, waiting for him to respond. He hung
above her, stiff with surprise. 
<P>    Then he sighed long and deep and relaxed, a load of
guilt seemingly lifted from his back. She raised her skirts,
drew him close between her thighs and murmured:
<P>    "And so, my love, there need be no more guarded speech
between us."
<P>    No speech at all, in fact; it was the pounding of his heart
that she listened for, not state secrets.
<P>    A light flared in the dark and a metallic voice sent their
bodies rigid.
<P>    "<I>Satisfaction</I>, sir, I <I>will</I> have satisfaction." Abruptly,
the light was masked. "Did you see clearly?" said the voice. It
was Maidstone.
<P>    A second voice answered: "Eh bien, monsieur, I see
everyt'ing."
<P>    She threw James off. She'd played the role of unfaithful
wife with unholy abandon. Now they faced the inevitable entrance
of the jealous husband, exactly as the script required.  But she
no longer knew where fiction left off and reality began.
<P>    "Get away!" She spat out the words. "He'll kill you."
<P>    Maidstone's voice from the shadows, the echo of a vengeful
fury. "You, Latour, stand by me with the lantern while I teach
the whelp a lesson."
<P>    A figure dropped from a nearby rock and dashed toward them.
Catherine was thrown violently to the sand.
<P>    "Out of the way, woman. I'll deal with <I>you</I> later. Playing
the slut a little too feelingly, don't you think?"
<P>    The frontier melodrama of dalliance, entrapment and
discredit was lurching toward real tragedy. She recoiled as he
thrust the butt of a pistol into her hand.
<P>    "Hold this while I settle with your paramour." She wasn't
the only one playing her role with abandon.
<P>    Maidstone whirled round in search of James. In the light of
the rising moon in the tree-tops, she saw the glitter of a knife
blade playing from hand to hand. The studied agitator had thrown
off all restraint to become the hot-blooded assassin.
<P>   "Come out, James m'boy. Make a fool of me will you? Tonight
I'm going to cut off your tender young pecker and tommorrow
morning we'll fry it over a slow fire for Captain Ames' breakfast
sausage."
<P>    As if on cue, the lantern was unshielded and set down on the
sand. She saw James huddling opposite near a rock, his position
revealed to Maidstone. The two circled round each other in the
dim light, but the lantern was soon kicked over and extinguished
in the first lunges and feints. They came together and she heard
the grunts of men struggling to topple each other in the dark,
the heavy planting of feet as each strove to gain some advantage
of weight or agility. The quicker writhing figure of James broke
free and turned to face his enemy, arms stretched out to ward
off the coming lunge. Steel flashed in the fist of Maidstone.
<P>    He lunged low but the blade sprang upward, striking the gut
with a slapping, tearing impact that Catherine could almost feel
in her own body. The stricken figure slumped, clawing frenziedly
at the other's garments. The wielder of the knife jerked himself
free but tripped heavily across the legs of his victim.
Thrashing on the sand, each strove to pin the other.
<P>    "Shoot woman, <I>shoot</I>, finish him off," cried Maidstone.
<P>    She ran forward and saw two dim shapes striving for final
victory. She raised the pistol in both hands.
<P>    "Hurry up, you faithless bitch, SHOOT!"
<P>    The blade wavered from throat to throat as two pairs of
desperate muscles grappled with life itself. Glimmering
moonlight picked out one bulging eye, an instant later, the
clenched teeth of his opponent.
<P>    She fired. The gun went off with a terrific report, multiple
bangs echoing from every cliff in the vicinity. Both men groaned
in unison and slumped; the knife fell on the sand. Then silence.
<P>    Maidstone, his eyes staring, clutched at his breast, a dark
stain growing beneath his hand. Catherine threw down the pistol
and was on her knees in front of him.
<P>    "I <I>am</I> sorry, my dear. I seem to have aimed badly."
<P>    She said this with an equanimity that surprised her. The
other party in the affray was now doubled up clasping his groin
and moaning softly. Then her calm abruptly deserted her.
<P>    "Oh James, are you going to die?"
<P>    Pulling aside the cupped hands, she felt to her shock a
vicious rent in his trousers extending from crotch to waist.
Now, she too joined in his inarticulate moan -- to see this
sprightly lad so cruelly unmanned. Tearing at his garments, she
undid his belt and pulled off his boots. Seizing trousers by the
cuffs, she yanked them down and ripped open the shreds of sliced
linen that still clung to his hips. Her hands met the severed
edges of ...
<P>    Down the beach, Maidstone's accomplice, Latour, tripped on a
rock and fell with a thump and a curse. The noise of his
scrambling had just died away when another set of boots
clattered over the stones in the opposite direction.
<P>    "I think it best we all hold our places while someone
strikes a light. Thank you very much."
<P>     It was Harris, pistol at the ready. She thought she'd never
heard a voice that exuded such an improbable sense of good
government in such a compromising situation. 
<P>    "You'll find a tinderbox in my coat pocket," rasped
Maidstone. "Over there, folded up on a rock," 
<P>    She went for the tinderbox and began to strike a light while
Harris brought the shattered lantern. Adjusting the wick, she
soon had it going again. The stricken man winced at the glare
and shut his eyes, fingering a broad crimson patch on his shirt.
While Harris towered above them all, Catherine turned the light
toward James.
<P>    Naked from the waist downward, he lay stretched out on the
sand, still writhing. At the same time, feebly attempting to
conceal his private parts with a leather-bound copy of Holy
Writ, deeply slashed through its cover. She snatched it away,
exposing his privates to public scrutiny.
<P>    "Ah," she said, "it's ... <I>you're</I> all right."
<P>    An audible sigh of relief escaped her as she gazed fondly at
the bruised organ, then round at three pairs of male eyes. All
unblinking in the lantern light, all disapproving for quite
different reasons. The corners of her mouth turned up in a
guilty grin and she hurriedly replaced the Biblical fig-leaf in
its former position.
<P>    Harris spoke: "Yes, well, ... I expect we should transport
Mr. Maidstone back to camp. And I suggest that you, James, rack
your brains for some adequate explanation of the damage to
Captain Ames' Bible."

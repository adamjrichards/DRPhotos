<BR><P><B>Preliminary thoughts</B>
The goal is to collect materials for an outline diary with a
few opinionated remarks thrown in. This could be reviewed for inclusion in
the annual Album. It should give a sense of context and continuity to the
pictures which will have their own captions. The diary should probably fit at
the bottom of the page, beneath the larger horizontal format proofs.
<BR>Try to include creative and home improv projects. These could also serve as
fill for those dry periods that have no pictures. Emphasize the "quest"
aspect, the creative journey. Trip planning a possible topic? Can imagine a
page with 3-4 thumbnails, plus commentary below. Using a sort of "pilgrim's
progress" narrative style. Here we go again, off on the rocky road to (say)
defining "landscape". 
<BR>   Procedure? Keep the diary in a separate file or interleave with pictures in
the camera portfolios? Depends on how the result is to be printed. If, with
the index prints in 2-column format, then should be interleaved. If,
separately, to be inserted in drop-in portfolio, then keep separate. Also
tried printing separately for later cut and paste insertion. Time consuming
and perhaps a little messy-looking.

<BR>

<BR><B><P>MARCH 23:   Film: La Neuvaine.</B>
THURDAY: movie About a terminal
illness. Faith and loss of faith. Am
assuming it must be morally uplifting
to get depressed in the service of such
a worthy theme.
<BR>FRIDAY: Merle leaves to visit Amy Yeh
in Charlotte, N.C. Derek: Heartbeat on
TVO + bottle of merlot. Cheery but not
very deep.
<BR>
<BR>SATURDAY: Sabbath service of
thanksgiving for the salvation of some
of our temple members from an auto
crash on their way home from Florida.
Had a part in the service. But when
reading in public, why does my accent
tend to become Hibernian? That
suggestion of levity didn't seem to
suit the context. Hope no one noticed.
"The situation may be grave, but never
serious," say we Irish from the far,
far, far Western Isles.
<BR>
<BR>Photo project idea: Where are the
beauties of yesteryear? Trapped in
Thorold? Wandering in Wainfleet?
<BR>
<BR>SAT, EVENING: Paths of Glory, with Kirk
Douglas. The girl who was goaded into
singing in the tavern became, in real
life, the actor's wife. This scene
always makes me sniffly.
<BR>
<A href="D144.htm#" target="_parent">D144 06-03-27 Home, Niag. Gorge </A>
<BR>

<BR><B><P>MARCH 27  Merle back from Charlotte, NC.</B>
THURSDAY: Lunch with George and Trevor
at the Wainfleet Motel, Chambers
Corners. Food not as ravishing as
suggested, but the company was good.
<BR>FRIDAY: Meeting with financial advisors
at RBC to provide basic info for a
computer simulation of our afterlife.
<BR><B><P>MARCH 10  University of Windsor.</B>
MONDAY: To the University of Windsor
with Merle for a PhD examination.
Parked on the campus which is near the
foot of the Ambassador Bridge,
installed Merle at the Faculty of Ed.
<BR>Took off on foot. Explored the Odette
Sculpture park on the waterfront. A
splendid walk from the bridge North to
the Windsor downtown area. The
sculpture is high quality and in warm
weather the paths are teeming with
strollers and children playing. Good
views of the Detroit skyline across the
water, ships passing.
<BR>
<BR>Arrive back at the Fac. of Ed. early to
join the candidate and her friends
nattering in the hallway outside the
examination room. Inside, a murmur of
sober discussion. Presently the door
opens and the new PhD receives
congratulations. We decamp to face 401
hwy, eastbound.
<BR>
<BR> The next link also contains diary+pictures experiments. I think
I like best the the combination of diary within the full picture
portfolio. But sometimes it's hard to combine the two because
each is originally compiled under slightly different
circumstances. The pictures may reference undocumented
experiences and the diary may contain ruminations that have
little to do with the pictures.
<BR> The original 35mm vacation slide shows probably demonstrate the
optimum combination of words and pictures. Virtually every
picture has some commentary, but none goes on for too long. So
it is not quite a pure <I>reading</I> experience. Next year's Lake Superior
kayaking also has a fair bit of diary interpolation in the picture portfolio. 
<BR>
<A href="superior.htm#" target="_parent">SUPERIOR Lake Superior kayaking</A>
<BR>

<BR> The diary below is more readable in the pure sense, but the
pictures require an extra and separate (and annoying) step to
view. The difficulty of combining the two seems to reinforce the
bias I've heard from writers that the reading experience is best
when pure, free of visual distractions. Then, the imagination
alone contructs the visual ambiance. And the writer, or her
publisher, doesn't have to pay for expensive and irrelevant
illustrations.
<BR>
<A href="D145.htm#" target="_parent">D145 06-04-10  Windsor, Montreal </A>
<BR>

<BR><B><P>APRIL 12: Montreal for Passover</B>
WEDNESDAY: We drive to Hamilton airport
via our favourite back road route. Dp.
11:45am, arr. 5:15pm, 5.5hrs. Cost
$800, return fare for 2. Compare 8-9hrs
by car, door-to-door. 750mi at
$0.75/mile, approx. $500.
<BR>
<BR>THURSDAY: The rites and rituals of
Passover, observed. 3-4-5 glasses of
wine. A much edited and abridged
service. Kids running everywhere.
Skipped the plagues of Egypt. Our
generation may be of a less ferocious
mentality than our ancestors, who were
apparently inclined, to chortle with
delight whenever our "enemies" got
justly whacked, and to moan "Why me, O
Lord?" when we were the ones to suffer
unlooked-for reverses.
<BR>
<BR>FRIDAY: Sunshine today. The whole
family takes the subway to a point near
the Oratory. Afterwards we walk in the
Cotes de Neiges Cemetery. Old
established, hilly, mausoleums and
obelisks. A large one commemorating the
battle of Ste. Eustache with a list
patriots transported to the Antipodes.
Clownish pictures going back home on
the subway. Men in Black.
<BR>
<BR>SATURDAY: A trip to the market in the
morning. Young Sasha a loose cannon,
wandering off and reaching for
forbidden fruit. Needs a leash or
stroller to pin him down to a
predictable location. But apparently
permissiveness is more the order of the
day in 2006. People might think a leash
sadistic. But we got away with it back
in the 60s. (Much to the disgust of
Nathan at the time.)
<BR>
<BR>Nat drives us to the airport. Flight
above the clouds, views of Lake Simcoe,
Burlington Bay, and QEW skyway while
approching Mt. Hope airport. "Skyway"
seems like a joke from 3000m altitude,
with the cars crawling across the
bridge, flea-like. 
<BR>
<BR>Back from Montreal. "B.B.Mtn", video
in evening. "What's it take to get your
attention, cowboy? A mating call?" This
really is a milestone, not just because
it's a gay movie, but a mainstream gay
movie. One where the viewer, whatever
their own orientation, has to take the
characters seriously for the
authenticity of their personal
relationships.
<BR><B><P>APRIL 16: AIA lecture at Brock.</B>
SUNDAY: "The Origins of Celtic
identity." Starting from Greek and
Roman writers up to modern times. Best
Powerpoint show in a long time. Pot
Luck afterwards at the Brown's in
N.O.T.L.
<BR>A garrulous cleric, holding forth in
the sun room, debunks my favourite book
of late. "Cleopatra" by Fletcher. Seems
her identification of C's mummy is not
upheld by many other archaelogists.
Also, she has offended the Egyptian
Antquities Department by publishing
unsubstantiated claims without
permission. I later check this out on
the net and find similar reservations
on the AIA site. Just goes to prove
that noisy, irritating people can
sometimes be quite correct in their
views.
<BR>
<BR>However, I think I had him for a moment
with my enthusiasm for "How the Irish
saved Civilization." In this book,
which has interesting takes on the
Decline of the Roman Empire, Augustine
is put forward as the real inventor of
the literary ego. That is, the
self-revealing memoir. No one in the
room could think of a comparable
earlier work. And my accent, aided by
several thimblefuls of the Brown's
sherry, grew ever more Oirish. Hope
Patrick Davies didn't notice, he can
impersonate real bog-trotting rustics.
<BR><B><P>APRIL 17: Photo albums.</B>
See notes.
<BR>
<BR>This 2-column format for the letter size, drop-in portfolios really lends
itself to including photographed notebook pages, book pages, sketches,
cartoons, etc.
<BR>Even selected portfolio photographs.
These need not be "selected" via
"alt-m", so they'll display only during
manual review of text. The vertical
space favours portrait format pictures,
or at most, two or three.

<BR><B><P>APRIL 18: wills, suicide bombers.</B>
TUESDAY: Finalize our wills this morning
at Muratori, et al. Many signatures.
Derek to the Glenridge Quarry after
lunch to gaze out over the scene and
write in his notebook.
<BR>Could be a weather station on the
summit: cool and steady breezes prevail
up here. Lots of sky for launching
weather balloons.
<BR>
<BR><P><B>APRIL 21: movie night</B>
FRIDAY: Saw "Paradise Now" at
the Welland Film Society last night. The
story of two suicide bombers seen from
the Palestinian POV.  "Water" by Deepa
Mehta the night before last. Had our
fill of depressing movies lately. P.N. a
"great" film, partly because of the
serious theme. But also because you
don't have to agree with the programme
of the suicide bombers to realize this
is a significant insight into their
sense of grievance and futility. Only by
death and martyrdom can they seem to
keep their own and Palestinian identity
alive. Italics all over the place -- did
not sleep well last night.
<BR>
<BR>And look at ME: an underwhelming urge
to document the Picturesque, to chart
the familiar corners of the known
universe. To fill notebooks with
obscure wit. Not even an artist. A mere
"vidutist". Hark! ( or Behold!) The
title of a picture has just popped into
my head: "Two sides of the same coign."
Must run out and find some punny
architectural details to fit that
thought.
<BR><B><P>APRIL 22: Toronto family reunion</B>
SATURDAY: Nathan and family arrive at
lunchtime. Cloudy, rainy. To the St.
Catharines market to get lunch fixings.
Home exhausted. Snooze through awful
cartoons on TV with Sasha.
<BR>SUNDAY: Off to TO for a family
reunion-type party at Martin and
Marion's condo rec room, 12 to 2pm. Not
enough room for us all in the minivan.
Since Nathan and family have to
continue on to Montreal anyway, they'll
bring Miriam and Dimitri later on. And
we'll bring the two of them home to St.
Catharines. Got it? I'm confused. Heavy
rain all the way. Derek reads the Star
while Merle drives. Bad news from
Afghanistan, navel-gazing in Hogtown.
Well, yes.
<BR>
<BR>Uneventful trip. We sit and wait in the
rec room for Natco, Miriam and Dimitri
to arrive. Remember? They're travelling
together from St. Catharines. Much
nibbling and nattering later, we still
see no sign of them at 12, 12:30, 1,
1:30, and 1:45pm.  They arrive 2-ish,
having assumed: "come anytime between
12 and 2", and by extraordinary
coincidence, also had traffic problems
on the QEW, and difficulties finding a
gas station. Luckily, a few of the
family are still present. Hello, my
name is Cassandra and no one is ever as
pessimistic as me, but I'm getting good
pictures today. And Beatrix is
adorable. With large windows, the room
is bright enough for hand-held
exposures without flash even on a
cloudy day.
<BR>
<BR>Home in the rain.

<BR><B><P>APRIL 24: Rain, Bootup problems.</B>
Rains and rains and never stops/ Forty
days and spoils the crops.  Corrupt
files on ED. Ants on the ceiling. Mice
in the pantry. Water in the whiskey.
<BR><B><P>APRIL 30: Torstar, FFF.</B>
SUNDAY: Toronto Star weekend edition
plus coffee. Every so often that paper
transcends its Toronto fixation and
publishes something of wider interest.
Then to Farr Rd. farm, for more coffee
and sweets.
<BR>There I encounter there a few more of
my favourite things: magnolias,
crocuses, the cats, squirrels, goats,
sheep, ducks, even Alphie, all
burgeoning, bounding, or gambolling in
the spring sunshine.
<BR>
<BR>Discussed the Nostalgia question with
M. in bed this morning. We should have
been celebrating the Rites of
Aphrodite. Prompted by a particularly
satisfying episode of "Heartbeat" last
Friday on TVO. 50s village life in
rural Blighty. An ambiance that for me
has a Danville-like magic. A "real"
environment, clouds, skies, seasons,
buildings made out of "real" materials
borrowed from that same environment.
People in "real" occupations: growing
things, repairing, building. 
<BR>
<BR>As a child in Danville, "The Old
Country", former home of my war-absent
Dad out on the Prairies, and also of my
grandparents, was a constant background.
I was brought up as a Colonial in a
family that remained conscious of what
they'd left behind. I learned to
respect this, though having no direct
experience of England myself. The
prevailing atmosphere of sentimental
retrospection was reinforced in
countless small ways: books showing
prehistoric and Roman ruins in Britain,
pre-war picture books and old British
magazines. The wartime BBC on the
wireless. The Eastern Townships of
Quebec at that time probably reinforced
these impressions. Modernity had been
choked off by the war. The horse and
buggy had a resurgence, gardens and
sidewalks in winter were ploughed by a
man with a horse. Houses were heated by
wood. In a horse-drawn sleigh, we
visited people on unploughed backroads,
who had no electricity but cheerfully
coped with the tasks of farming. The
isolation of English speakers in a
French-speaking province also helped to
increase that wartime sense of seige, of
clinging to anachronism because the
present wasn't all that certain.
<BR>
<BR>Did my taxes today. Had to repeat the
calculations 3 times due to major
errors. Lots of erasing.
<BR>
<BR>"Under the Greenwood Tree", Hardy, on
Masterpiece Theatre. More nostalgia.
<BR><B><P>MAY 2: Quarry, the path leads ...</B>
TUESDAY:  M. to a meeting at Brock. D.
on a walk in Glenridge Quarry. Can see
TO from the summit. Walking the paths,
was struck by how good a metaphor "The
Path" is for Life.
<BR>"The Portal" is a strong metaphor too,
but it stands for the isolated
incident, some particular choice,
phase,or transition, not so much as a
steady state or an ongoing process.
Life contains Portals, but Life IS a
journey, something with the continuity,
the ups and downs of a dramatic plot.
Journeys are made on Paths, sometimes
with companions, sometimes solitary.
Paths lead to portals, but once there,
we go through or turn aside, and the
journey resumes.
<BR>
<BR>Just heard 3 strong but distant booms
from the direction of Fonthill.
Probably blasting at the quarry. The
sound actually echoed off the Woodside
woods to the north of the summit. While
the butterflies flutter and the meadow
birds twitter, I immediately think of
big seige guns. Comes of being an armed
forces brat, I suppose.
<BR>
<BR>Hunger, fatigue, weather, animals,
plants, unexpected encounters, danger,
perseverance, final revelation on
reaching an eminence. All are here on
this path. If I ever did anything
really civic-minded in the Niagara
Region it should probably be to work in
support of trails, bike paths and
parks.
<BR><B><P>MAY 5: La Traviata, Hamilton.</B>
Another replay of the "virtuous
coutesan meets tragic end" theme. But
first, to Dalina's Egyptian resto with
the Silvers. Major social faux pas. Had
a rip in the seat of my pants. Had to walk behind anyone who
might notice.
<BR>Another shock: "you've got your hair
cut." Did it myself in honour of my 69th
b'day tomorrow. Kept alert throughout
the opera, put off by the libretto which
caters to the sentiment that
"wickedness" must be punished, and that
tuberculosis, not middle-class morality,
can take the blame for the death sentence.
<BR><B><P>MAY 8:Tree-felling, Thornhill</B>
Angus and I pull down a dead tree this
morning. He has been hankering to have
a go for weeks now. It missed us by
10ft. More soffit work. Hughes'
magnolia has finished blooming. Always a fin-de-siecle feeling.
<BR>On Sunday to Thornhill for a family
anniversary or something. Arrived back
in time for the AIA lecture dinner at
the Oasis Resto.
<BR><B><P>MAY 9: Dimitri, the Amazon, Last spike.</B>
Dimitri here last night on his way to
the Amazon jungle. Brought me a
Kraftwerk CD. Drove "the last spike"
(robertson screw actually) this morning
in my soffit project.
<BR>
<BR>Now suffering from "post-soffit"
depression -- lack of a well-defined
(and well-desired) follow-up project.
A new symptom in the annals of
shrinkmanship?
<BR>
<BR><B><P>MAY 10: Quarry</B>
Glenridge Quarry again. Road of life
and that sort of thing. Listened to a
soap-opera of that name when I was sick
as a kid in Danville during the 1940s.
<BR>Today a rest-the-back, tidy-up day.
Advance streamers of cirrus overhead.
Fraught. Sketch. Butterflies and
killdeers all over.
<BR>
<BR>
<A href="D149.htm#" target="_parent">D149 06-05-14  Biking to Port Robinson, NP school of hort. </A>
<BR>

<BR><B><P>MAY 20: Biking to Port Robinson.</B>
By 4pm, popped a tin of pop in the rucksack and hit the road.
Took the new and improved bike path along the Welland Canal. The
"Darien Gap" south of Thorold has been close by a new foot and
bike bridge. Turnround at Port Robinson.
<BR>The "Bridgit" ferry could take
passengers across the canal for an
extension of the route all the way
south  to Farr Rd. Must find out the
schedule. Home again. 33km in 2hrs
11min.
<BR>
<BR>Merle in Buffalo, supper of leftovers
and Hernder Baco Noir, 2001. Not so
"robust" as Henry of Pelham.
<BR><B><P>MAY 28: Skunk, light planes</B>
Sleep interrupted last night by a skunk
wandering under the bedroom window.
Trouble sleeping from the odour.
Finally came awake listening to an
account of the trade in cadaver body
parts on the radio.
<BR>Apparently Alistair Cooke of "Letter
from America", and "Masterpiece
Theatre" fame was NOT cremated as he
had wished.
<BR>
<BR>Small propeller planes droning through
the afternoon skies remind me of
aircraft sounds in Danville and St.
Hubert. My first plane ride was in a
Piper Cub from a grass airstrip south
of Richmond, probably 1946. $15. Dad
thought an Air Force brat needed the
experience. A highlight of my life for
months. Made a drawing, now lost, that
sticks in my mind.

<BR><B><P>JUNE 5: Whiz-bang.</B>
Tomorrow a mystic day, date-wise. Up
early to check my traplines. One more
mouse, neatly whacked across the neck.
Eyes, little "X"s. (And now, Igor, for
my next weectim.)
<BR>Imagine a line of mouse pelts on tiny
stretchers tacked up beside the kitchen
door with push-pins. In Toronto, news
of ammonium nitrate, teen-age
alienation and "the wrongs done to my
people."
<BR>
<BR>   Actually, male youth, is the
probably the most unstable compund
known. In my day we made explosives
just for the whiz-bang effect. How
naive we were. How naive THEY are.
Strike a blow for Justice, plot
mayhem in the name of a Better
World. At one time I half believed all
that Fidel and Che stuff. Well, "in
theory, and without the terrorism
aspect", still do, sort of.
<BR>
<BR>Actually Che, himself put the finger on
it. Explaining the failure of the
revolution in Bolivia he said
somewhere: "We failed to incorporate
the peasants." Real Revolution is a
peoples' movement to incorporate
themselves, not an elite insurrection
by surrogate peasants.
<BR><B><P>JUNE 12: Glenridge summit again.</B>
Cloudy, breezy. A transformation since
last time. Daisies by the acre.
Yesterday, Long Point to walk the
beach. A chicken sandwich shared with
Merle while sitting below a sand dune.
<BR>The amiance surpasses the best
restaurant. Back home through a string
of village along the coast. Coffee and
back alleys in Port Dover full of
decrepit machinery. Back someday for a
photo shoot.
<BR>
<BR>Can't see the TO skyline this morn.
Heard on the radio of the demolition of
the "four sisters", the stacks of the
Lakeview Generating Station. These have
been visible from the summit in good
visibility conditions. During my days
at the AMB we were constantly
calculating pollution output from these
chimneys.

Scouted by car for navigation

Davidson. The old railway trestle is
about the furthest upstream practical.
Above, sluggish flow, shallows, rocks.

<I>p7170002 06-07-04</I> - <B>notes.</B><xxx>

<BR>
<BR>Then to Port Colborne. Parked at
Lakeside Park, then biked to Fort Erie
in 1hr 45mins, pedalling strongly.
Beautiful trail, lush hedges and
(boringly?) straight. Ridgeville, a
good stop for a snack on the way back.
Met Bruce Kershner in Fort Erie
checking out the old trees near the
pier ruins. He looked a bit peculiar.
Said he was battling some illness and
would welcome an Email. Sent one, no
reply. Heard some months later that he
was dead of cancer. He was the leading
figure in Western New York and Southern
Ontario on the subject of old growth
forest. I must have seen him on one of
his last outings.
<BR><B><P>JULY 12: Gloom, sunsets.</B>
Low, unbroken overcast, rain. Sleeping
in the basement these days, gloomy but
cool. Depressive afternoon yesterday.
Brooding about life in general, then
downhill from there. Garden projects
kicked in about 4:30pm.
<BR>A project, real physical effort nearly
always makes me feel better, but how to
get started when you're already down?
Have made myself an "old custom"
recently, 8:15pm-ish, quit work, drinks
on the side terrace. Surprising how
happy one or two cups of wine can make
me feel. I admire my new steps, the
plume poppies, the queen anne's lace (a
statuesque weed), glimpses of
passers-by in the street. I turn on my
string of festive butterfly lights,
watch a mouse skitter across the steps,
the clouds move, the sun goes down behind
Angus' transformer -- and feel
unreasonably happy.
<BR>
<BR>Finished "British Sea Power", David
Howorth. For an old colonial like me,
hard to suppress the "Hearts of Oak"
music playing in the background.

<BR><B><P>JULY 23: Montreal.</B>
Its Euro wine or tough baguettes to you
buddy. Had to forgo my Niagara Baco
Noir for a few days. Took the kids to
the Jardin Botanique. Sasha loved the
endless twisting paths. Didn't lose him
for more than a few minutes at a time.
<BR>Recall visiting the botanical garden,
roundabout '46 with Uncle Fraser. I
remember wide open areas and very
sparse planting, the opposite of today.
<BR>
<BR>To an Asterix movie with the kids. Back
home watched "13 Warriors", a Viking
movie set on Vancouver Island. The
hero, a Muslim, and a band of mercenary
Vikings travel "north" to avenge some
unspeakable evil besetting remote
villages. The Vikings presumeably have
been in the service of the Sultan in
Istanbul.
<BR>
<BR>A robin sings in the backyard at dusk.
I recall an evening at the Cliff's
apartment on Somerled Ave. Probably '46
or '47. An incident in the making of an
aesthete. One of those magic spring
evenings. still a little fresh, but
with the promise of summer, when sounds
and odours seem so poignant after
winter's deadness. Sat in a garden
chair and doted on that scene: About
nine years old.

Assembled kayak in 27 minutes today,
improving. Have dispensed with the
rudder -- it doesn't matter where
you're going, it's the journey that
counts. Paddled to the opposite shore
and swam.
<BR>Ensign Fielding and Catharine Montague
(alias Mrs. Maidstone). Balanced her on
his hands, he did, just at the water's
suface and watched the water sluice up
and down her flanks and... To Minden
for a horticultural and quilt show.
Everyone so all-fired cheerful.
Kayaking with Martin in the alpenglow
at dusk.
<BR>
<BR>Home again: have considered the ups and
downs of owning a cottage. Despite the
convenience of "all mod cons" in the
wilderness, we should probably opt for
more mobility in our travel
arrangements.

<BR><B><P>AUGUST 1: A breeze at the summit.</B>
The daisy fields of last time are now
replaced with mature grasses.
Grasshoppers by the million, a bonanza
if you're a critter who likes locusts
and honey.
<BR>Was thinking on the way up: (1) Merle
has the calves of a walker or a
mountain climber. (2) Wouldn't 6000ft
go nice right now. (3) High-up turkey vultures
patrolling the Escarpment. Do these
things constitute a pattern?
<BR>
<BR>Got to make up our minds to DO
something this summer. Miriam and Adoni
want to motor all the way to
Newfoundland via Quebec and Labrador,
an ambitious project invoving a serious
ferry trip.

Sitting atop Glenridge Summit, still
wondering how to integrate photography,
sketching and general note-making.
<BR>Photos don't seem to belong in my
little black pocket notebooks even if
there was a way to produce 4x6in index

more of the "artistic" side of

<BR><B><P>AUGUST 11: Fort Erie concert.</B>
Attended Niagara Symphony concert at
Fort Erie Friday evening. A small
concert band, no strings. For added
ambiance, an old-time military
encampment outside the fort.
<BR>Rows of white tents, troops going about
in period dress, a slight suggestion of
woodsmoke in the air. Began in warm
slanting sun, cooled by dusk. 200 or
more guests. This place saw terrific
battles in the war. and here we sit
listening to deedle-deedle music on the
very spot where hundreds died. (see
drawing.)
<BR>
<BR>Played "The Italian Girl in Algiers", a
perfect Bugs Bunny piece. Saw it in
Hamilton a few years back. Was this the
one where the escaping prisoners con
the Caliph into singing a very funny
nonsense song?
<BR><B><P>AUGUST 12: Biking, Niagara Parkway.</B>
We arrive Riverview Park at 6pm. Drive
S. with declining sun behind us till
7:20pm. About 15km of almost continuous
upscale residential frontage. Old
trees, well-tended lawns. Very few
bikes on the path.
<BR>An almost surreal experience. Many houses
seem to have no one home. Encourages
that sci-fi, deserted village
impression. We sit on a park bench at
Mackenzie point, just N. of Fort Erie,
looking across the Niagara River
towards Buffalo. A few industrial
buildings are visible. This is the
place where the rebel Wm. Lyon
Mackenzie escaped to the US with the
militia arriving a moment too late to
intercept him.
<BR>
<BR>Arrive back at the parking lot after
dusk, but easy riding in the dark on
the bike path -- no cars.
<BR><B><P>AUGUST 17: To Montreal tomorrow.</B>
On the eve of our trip, have this
"would rather stay home and hang out"
feeling. I hate making travel
arrangements.
<BR>We arrive in Montreal with Miriam and
Adoni, then begins a series of agonzied
phone calls from Dimitri who is taking
care of the animals. The blue Dodge
Caravan has broken down, no credit card
to get it fixed, and no transportation
to get food for the animals at Farr Rd.
or to get to Brock for work. We decide
to abandon the trip and return home to
sort things out.
<BR>
<BR>A day or so later Merle and I decide to
go to the Adirondack alone to rescue
what's left of our vacation time.

<BR><B><P>SEPTEMBER 8: Home from the Adirondacks.</B>
Got back home last Monday. Now sitting
atop the Glenridge Summit
contemplating. Can hardly bear to
unpack, after first not wanting to go
anywhere at all, then abandoning our
trip while in Montreal.
<BR>Don't want to admit we're back to
routine. What would it be like to live
in Lake Placid or Concord NH for a
month at a time?
<BR>
<BR>We climbed 4 mountains while away:
Rooster Comb, Giant, Noonmark and Mt.
Jo. Slightly smaller peaks than New
Hampshire, less exposed so the crowns
tend to be less open. More bushwhacking
to get to the good stuff (bare rocks.)
Some lovely views, casually met quite a
few friendly people. This sort of
outing seems to put people in a good
mood, either that or a selection
process is at work. Only the keenest
ones show up at the trailhead. I think
if we were making more of an effort to
find new friends I'd ty to exchange
calling cards or Email addresses with
people met on this kind of outing.
<BR>
<BR>Slept in the car all nights but one, by
reason of mildew odours in the tent.
Surprsingly comfortable, cozy, if a bit
constricted. Ventilation could have
been a problem in warmer weather. Open
windows and the mosquitoes come in. We
experimented with mosquito netting.

<BR><B><P>SEPTEMBER 27: Glenridge Summit again.</B>
Hey, I'm becoming the hermit guru of
this place, coming up here so often.
Plenty of crickets and grasshoppers.
Wine-dark leaves on distant bushes.
Burgundy colour ... Burgundians...
<BR>Calls to mind the city of Trier,
Germany. Visited it in the 1950s.
Should dust off my BW negatives. A
whole world of ancient DR history in
there to explore. And while we're in
nostalgia mode: have just read
annotated book of Sisley's painting.
Not sure he's a major fave, but
something stikes a note of kinship. His
affection for, and interest in the
scene before him, not only an
opportunity to display virtuosity, but
homage to a loved subject matter.
<BR>
<BR>A grasshopper sits on my cuff and
contemplates the scene, an ant, more
industrious, tries to take a piece of
my hand home for the winter.
<BR>
<BR>Finished Pat O'Brien: "The Golden
Ocean." About a young man on Anson's
voyage to the South Pacific. Almost a
boy's book, yet written with an adult
voice. I loved the articulate and comic
dialogue, clever invective, constant
suggestions of an "Oirish" mode of
speech, hyperbolic, witty, not afraid
of being wordy, if the wordiness is
elegant. Reminds me of my own lost
years working on "The Scarlet Thread",
also a youth book, but really written
for an adult audience.
<BR>
<BR>Sitting up here watching the wind turn
the distant leaves over, revealing
silver, speculating about Burgundy,
Trier, Sisley's Isle de France, Anson's
South Seas, seranaded by crickets -- it
almost comes to me, immortality, for a
few moments at least.

<BR><P><B>Notes on procedure</B>
<BR>
<BR>   07-10-11: Improvements to/head cmd. Reformatted all diary entries to
suit.
<BR>
<BR>   07-10-18: Second thoughts on diary entries. May not be as much reason to
transcribe diary entries as first thought. See d192.ptf. Scans or photos of
diary pages seem almost as useful. Saves a lot of typing. The "/gra ..." tag
for each page serves as an anchor and textual reference, if the date and
title and ph. page number are entered. A pithy 6-line precis could be
entered, with the displayed page at the top of the screen.
<BR>   Rather than entering text direct from diary notebook, may be easier to
import the graphic pages, then add any textual comments or identifying info
in the containing .PTF file. ie.don't enter the text, then look for scattered
notebook images to add to it for illustration. Instead, keep all the notebook
images in an approp.-named file, then add a minimum of text to describe them.
<BR>   Could do the same with other photo ephemera, eg. travel brchures, maps,
etc. Could be filed by date, eg. Y071018.jpg, then later referenced, like
diary entries, by date. 
<BR>
<BR> 08-01-22: experimented with interpolating whole pages into existing album.
Then with footnote style 2 inch pages tacked on at bottom. The whole pages
are too much text in one chunk but would be easy to insert. The foot-note
approach is impossible to insert. Both have the problem of incomplete pages
or orphan text. Difficult to predict where to continue when reading a
truncated bit. Looks like the only practical way to go is the interpolated
diary entry. These would be easiest to insert if contained in the camera
card portfolio file. This was the option I had rejected earlier. Now, I
think that the easiest approach would be to photograph the diary pages and
any other ephemera, then, while preparing the photo album pages, also
transcribe and augment as much of the diary as seems interesting.
<BR>
<BR> 08-12-04: See year 2008 for different thoughts on diary entries. 2-column
pages with condensed footnote diary entries. Word6 handling of footnotes.
<BR>
<BR> 10-04-19: Added group headings w. date.
<BR>
<BR> 16-02-28: More ruminations about combining diaries and photos.
Just read and did minor edits on the above diary. Struck by how
well it (I?) reads, without pictures. But can't live without
pictures. Trains passing in the night? Parallel universes? Why?
What? Wither? Whence? Wherefore? Pictures are lovely, but they
do tend to distract that part of the mental reconstuctive
process that operates through reading. Recorded sound slide
shows are another complication in this question. 
<BR>
<BR> 16-03-30: Added picture selection.

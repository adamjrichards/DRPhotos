<BR><P>Greece, departure.</B>
<I>97-05-29 Thurday</I>   G-day today. Why do I always feel this dark sense of
forboding as we begin a trip?
<BR>Just now, we're hurtling toward the Labrador coast at 4:51pm, 855km/hr.,
heading north-west at 10,400m. altitude. What's to worry about?
<BR>   The Airbus position and speed display on a video monitor is hypnotic and a
little boring. We achieve re-enty in Athens at 12:08pm (today or tomorrow?)
<BR>   <I>97-05-30 Friday</I>   Baggage out of hock. Walkabout in Piraeus with Miriam,
Adoni and Dimitri. Gardens, flowers on balconies. Chaotic but cheerful. We
attend a wedding this evening. Much retsina. Scads of relatives. Don't know
anybody except the immediate family. A few cousins, nephews, etc. who speak
some English. After several hours, much conviviality and copious Danforth
food we begin to really enjoy Greek popular music.

<I>0422-02b 97-05-31</I> - <B>Stoa of Attalus, Athens.</B><xxx>

<BR><I>97-05-31 Saturday</I>   Downtown Athens by bus and subway. Tower of the Winds,
The Stoa of Attalus, the Dionysius theatre, the Agora. Ruins.
<BR>I hear a spectral voice: "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings. Look on my
works, ye mighty and despair." We despair at a Plaka rip-off lunch that costs
about $40 for a mere snack.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/n33/n33p113c.jpeg">
<I>n33p113c 97-05-31</I> - <B>The Agora, Athens</B><xxx>

<BR>Afternoon: our first visit to the Acropolis. We stay the night at Zoe's, near
the harbour of ancient Piraeus.
<BR><P>Next: Lesbos.</B>
<I>97-06-01 Sunday</I>   Ferry at 4:00pm. At dusk, on the breezy open deck, gazing
seaward, I'm on the verge of hypothermia.
<BR>   Till I climb into my sleeping bag and stretch out on a bench.  Drifting into
a shallow sleep, I have a conversation with my old buddy Richard Peters, also
on board this ship. He reports few real women-of-mystery aboard. But one,
with her mother: pale, Queen Street complexion, dark glasses and long, long
frizzy hair. She keeps going to the rail and staring out over the waves for a
lengthy interval. Dreaming perhaps of some absent lover (or how to get away
from her mom to fraternize with those Greek soldiers on board who are now
going back to their army bases on Lesbos.)
<BR>   <I>97-06-02 Monday</I>   The dawn comes up like thunder out of Turkey, cross the
bay. We dock at Mytilene, at some ungodly early hour. Breakfast of <I>bougatsa</I>
and coffee amid the wreckage of last night's ouzo drinkers.
<BR>A walk round the old Byantine castle before lunch. This was the site of one
of Julius Caesar's first battles. Still a military site with Greek soldiers.
<BR>They sit in a bunker by the water's edge, fingering worry-beads and staring
at the Turkish coastline through binoculars.
<BR> Miriam out hunting for bees. Research, or so she says. Perhaps she's
checking out the defences.
<BR>

<I>n33p114 97-06-02</I> - <B>Salina's Garden Rooms, Mytilini, Lesbos.</B><xxx>

<BR>We find rooms at Salina's Garden. Perfect, including the Ottoman flush toilet
that we eventually coax to work. No hot water, but the cold is comfortably
lukewarm.
<BR>This comes from a roof-top cistern that's been warmed enough by the sun for a
comfortable bathe.
<BR>   Nap- and shower-refreshed, I sit on the rooftop terrace overlooking the
garden, happily writing and making a sketch. The doves in the neighbouring
dove-cote are endlessly repeating: "what sorrow, what sorrow ..." How did
such a pessimistic fowl ever get desigated: The Bird of Peace?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0422/0422-01a.jpeg">
<I>0422-01a 97-06-02</I> - <B>Mytilini, Lesbos.</B><xxx>

<BR>We walk up the hill behind the town in the evening. Then follow a road to the
site of the old theatre. The Turkish coast is just visible in the background.
<BR>We cross a field that has apparently been used for military excercises:
barbed wire and eroded foxholes. I wake up that night in a cold sweat ...
<BR>   wondering if we could have stepped on a World War II landmine.
<BR>   <I>97-06-03 Tuesday</I>   Breakfast on the waterfront. We rent an under-powered
Fiat 850 for a drive to Molivos on the other side of the island. An exciting
time creeping up the steep incline out of town in first gear, the engine
whining, and passed at high speed on blind curves by everyone else.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/n33/n33p116.jpeg">
<I>n33p116 97-06-03</I> - <B>The view from Molivos Castle, Lesbos.</B><xxx>

<BR>It rains a bit while exploring the castle. A few drops fall on my sketches.
Had to scribble down the names of the colours for future reference.
<BR>Damn hard to draw rocks and masonry quickly, so much detail. Photography is
more convenient but lacks the feeling of on-site rapport with the subject.
<BR>   I natter with a couple of Brits on the ramparts while roughing in a few
sketches. "Had your jabs?" they wonder. "Rabies y'know." Worried that the
continent is being ravaged by packs of foaming cats and dogs. Hmmm. Dimitri
<I>had</I> been nipped by a foraging cat in the Plaka when we stopped for lunch
the other day.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/112/1122-32.jpeg">
<I>1122-32 97-06-03</I> - <B>Ouzo interval, Molivos</B><xxx>

<BR>Walking down from the castle: we rest at the Tropicana Bar and sip ouzo under
a huge plane tree. (Unhand my glass young Dimitri.)
<BR>Glen Gould is playing Goldberg Variations over the PA system.
Just when I was getting used to Never on Sunday music.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/112/1122-35.jpeg">

<I>1122-36 97-06-03</I> - <B>Molivos, Lesbos.</B><xxx>

<BR>The collection of door and window pictures grows.
<BR>Keep wondering what I would do alone on a trip like this. ( Probably starve
or get lost without translators.) Maybe spend much more time sketching.
<BR>   People wouldn't have to wait for me to get a move on. Team up with old
Richard Peters again, perhaps to do some research into his eccentric notions
on the subject of "landscape philosophy." (ie. the theoretical side of
Outdoor Ed, dressed up in art-manifesto type language.)
<BR>   Later, we visit the church of the Virgin Mary's Sweet Kiss ("glycofilousa").
It sits, perched on a rock in Petra, near Molivos. Speaking of glycofilousas,
I wonder what <I>Merle</I> is doing right now, way back in Canada.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/n33/n33p117a.jpeg">
<I>n33p117a 97-06-04</I> - <B>Agiassos, Lesbos</B><xxx>

<BR><I>97-06-04 Wednesday</I>   To Agiassos, an interior hill-town with its own Mount
Olympus. We climb to a small chapel overlooking the town.
<BR>Down again to visit the cathedral and enclosure.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/112/1123-10a.jpeg">
<I>1123-10a 97-06-04</I> - <B>Agiassos, Lesbos.</B><xxx>

<BR>On the other side of town, a steep path to the Castelli, a church on a peak
with a splendid view. Coffee near the Cathedral.
<BR>There we discuss Agiassos in the wintertime with a waitress who prefers
bright lights to historical ambiance. Not so nice as Seattle, she says.
<BR>   Dreadfully boring with all those old fogies around (I cringe.) Huge influx
of Eurodollars, but only for the big guys, not <I>kafeneion</I> waitresses.
<BR>   Ferry back to Athens. An hour or so out of Mytilini, I notice a suspicious,
swarthy, bearded character watching me draw from the upper deck. Looks a lot
like someone living rough. Looks a lot like <I>us</I> actually, with that slightly
oily, tousle-haired, rumple-clothed look.
<BR>   Eventually he asks me in English if I'm an artist. The cape I'm drawing on
the Turkish coastline was the site of a town called Pontos or Portos back in
the days of Magna Graecia, he says. It was the parent town of present day
Marseilles. The colonists moved in two steps, first to Sicily, then to
southern Gaul where they put on berets and striped shirts and opened
water-front cafes for package tourists from Manchester.
<BR>   He seemed gratified that a foreigner should have taken an interest his old
stamping-ground.
<BR><P>Next: back in Athens, then Monemvasia.</B>
<BR>   <I>97-06-05 Thursday</I>   To the Cycladic Museum, and afterwards, we climb Mt.
Lycabettos. English sex-farce on TV at supper tonight.
<BR>Amusing images and references to coital positions. The whole family watches
from the dinner table. Then Robo-Cop. Phone call from Canada at midnight:
Merle's plane will be delayed tomorrow.
<BR>   <I>97-06-06 Friday</I>   Miriam confirms this morning that Merle is probably in
the sky over Coburg right now. A little rain today, dries in 3 milliseconds.
Adoni reminisces about the old neighbourhood in Piraeus. Merle arrives,
exhausted but gorgeous. Impresses the heck out of Grigori who has driven us
to the airport to wait.
<BR>   <I>97-06-07 Saturday</I>   We catch the Flying Doplphin hydrofoil from Piraeus
to various south-westerly ports. Eat picnic lunch on the dock when we arrive
at Monemvasia. Hike across the mole to this Gibraltar of the Peloponesus.
Visit the old town which we enter via the famous (and only) gate with the
tricky zig-zag turn.

<BR>We hang out in back alleys, cafes. This place is a living museum with strict
standards of modernization. Everything must be tile, masonry, wrought iron.
<BR>The cash-registers, however, are thoroughly modern.

<BR>Up a switchback path to the fortified area above the town. This is a sloping
plateau still ringed with vestigial walls to keep tourist from falling off.
<BR>All the way down to the boutiques far below.

<BR>Taxi ride up a pot-holed road to Agios Nicolaos, otherwise: "The Village".
<BR>(They voted Royalist last election and are now being punished by the
left-leaning roads department.) We're late.  Zoe waits with folded arms.

<I>n33p134 97-06-09</I> - <B>Window, Tsikalia.</B><xxx>

<BR><I>97-06-09 Monday</I>  Head back from the village to Piraeus in Evaggelia's car.
Tour the Mani on the way. Eerie, nearly deserted hill town, fortified towers.
<BR>We wander the alleyways, looking at buildings and stonework.
<BR>   The only sign of life is a dog barking in someone's yard. Adoni thinks
these are weekend houses, maintained mostly by Athenians.
<BR>   <I>97-06-10 Tuesday</I>   To the Parthenon with Merle and Miriam and Dimitri.
We perch on the Areopagus rock listening to a tour guide lecture a visiting
group from Japan. Our friend Jim Mayberry would find it amusing to join
in and astonish them with his Japanese.
<BR><P>Next: Macedonia and Olympus.</B>
<I>97-06-11 Wednesday</I>  Up at 5:00am to head north. Over the mountains to
the plain of Thessaly.
<BR>To Litohoro for a lunch (3:45pm) of very large, very delicious beans. Visit a
tiny, perfect castle on the seaside. Then up the side of Olympus to Stavros'
place for the night. Reconnaissance of the road to Prionia after supper.
Misty-gray. Many axle-breaking rocks.
<BR>   That evening, attending to the last business of the day, I'm peering out a
crack in the outhouse door in the backyard at Stavros' place. A terrific bang
and flash, kilometers away on the plain below Mt. Olympus rocks me on my
precarious foundation. Something streaks away into the air in an easterly
direction over the Aegean. I sincerely hope it isn't a missile heading for
Turkey.  Wouldn't want to be caught like this in the middle of an
international incident. Bangs at regular intervals that evening announce
artillery practice with some serious weaponry at Litohoro army camp.
<BR>   <I>97-06-12 Thursday</I>  At breakfast, Stavros suggests we climb to the
shelter above Prionia, stay the night, complete the ascent next day,
well-rested. We drive to Prionia, park the car, lace up our climbing boots
and begin the climb to the shelter, but decide to press on for the summit
since the weather is perfect. Merle and Derek turn back exhausted after 8
hours, 200m short, but enjoy superlative views. Miriam, Adoni and Dimitri
press on and reach the Mytikas and Skolio summits. We all stay the night
along with a noisy crowd of German tourists.
<BR>   <I>97-06-13 Friday</I>   On wobbly legs, we stumble down to the car in Prionia,
after a night spent in damp wool blankets. A splash in the brook to refresh
and then drive north to Dion. Temple of Isis. First century pipe organ in the
museum. To the Hotel Veroi in Veria.  A pleasant northern town of
friendly-looking people, all of them out for an evening stroll.
<BR>   <I>97-06-14 Saturday</I>   Vergina, palace of Phillip II, Alex's dad. The Royal
tombs are encased in an air-conditioned mausoleum. On to Meteora, where we
climb to a monastery for the good of our souls (uplifting view, not prayers).
<BR>

<I>1125-21a 97-06-14</I> - <B>Siatista, Macedonia.</B><xxx>

<BR>Picturesque towns along the road home. Halvah at Pharsala at midnight, on the
way back to Athens. An epic battle of western civilization was fought here.
<BR>But that was back in classical times. Tonight, all is quiet, except for a
priest selling nic-nacs and candy. Raising money for a new church roof?

<BR><I>97-06-16 Monday</I>  Arrive Heraklion at dawn. Bus to Knossos -- Evansville,
Crete. The palace really <I>is</I> a labyrinth.
<BR>After visiting the museum back in Heraklion,  getting a better view of Minoan
artwork, I  regret that this happy-<I>looking</I> civilization should have been
wiped out so completely. The guidebook, however, makes dark hints about human
sacrifice in the City of Light. Sounds a little like sour grapes to me.
<BR>   Bus to Sitea. Heroic scenery. The road-side flowers are incredible.

mentioned in the guidebook. Shopping instead. Hot. Swimming in front of the
hotel.

<BR>At the site of the ancient Asclepian complex nearby, a frisson of recognition.
A kind of waking dream.
<BR>Noticing door sills, with slots for door-posts all in a row, I'm startled to
visualise the doors of sick rooms swinging open, visitors coming and going.
<BR>   Usually the old stones are only faceless wreckage to the tourist. But
sometimes a single detail releases the catch on a mental jack-in-the-box,
triggering a whole fountain of associations.

<BR>Walkabout and lunch in Nauplion. Hot. Grigori wonders why Derek won't take
off his shirt. Derek wonders why Grigori isn't worried about sunburn.
<BR>   The Nauplion acropolis is reached by a covered, bomb-proof passage. This
leads up from sea level to assure the safe delivery of supplies in wartime.
Today the castle is reached by 899 steps which we don't have the time or the
energy to attempt in the 40 degree heat.
<BR>   Built by the Venetians in a few years before 1714, it cost <I>mega</I>-ducats,

<I>1126-31 97-06-21</I> - <B>The Lion Gate, Mycenae.</B><xxx>

<BR>Mycenae. A most excellent portal for my collection. We visit the Treasury of
Atreus.
<BR>Standing on the barren summit of the citadel, we speculate on the life of the
region. Miles of olive groves, then orange trees, dark green down to the sea.
<BR>   We find some candles beside the entrance to the underground cistern. Also,
matches in the boy-scout pockets of my rucksack. We centimetre our way down
the stairs by flickering candle-light.  At 15 metres depth, damp walls. Cool
enough for long sleeves. Derek first (genetically expendable, according to
Miriam), Dimitri next. We see nothing, really, only a gaping void ahead of
us, sloping all the way down to Hades at 45 degrees. Say, what's that glowing
down there in the stygian depths? Looks like a figure with a pitchfork.
<BR>   Hmm, best pop back up to the surface and see if Merle and Grigori are
looking for us. Or if they've even noticed that we've gone part way to hell.

<BR>Acrocorinth, medieval fortifications in the background.
<BR>Pheidippides, or perhaps it was Richard Peters, years after having officially
died, the triumphal winner of the first marathon from Marathon to Athens,
reports meeting a certain statuesque Dacian princess in Corinth.
<BR>   Or perhaps it was merely one of the lady's Judeo-Slavic descendants on a
holiday from Canada. In any case, in his later years, Richard proclaims
himself tired out from flirting with death by physical fitness every weekend;
he's now decided to give up marathons and take up fictional travel writing
instead. That way he can chase women-of-mystery all around the Agean.

Temple of Apollo alongside a New Age Woman of Mystery.
<BR>   In the stadium, Dimitri sprints the length in 35 seconds. Derek walks it
in 2:08. Heat-stressed, we do the Stations of the Cypress all the way up and
down. Their dense shade gives us some relief from the glare.
<BR>Lunch in Eptalophos, the village of 7 mountains, near Parnassos. In the Greek
Tyrol -- ski country.
<BR>It's been a rare day. Back in Piraeus and on the verge of returning to
Canada, we decide to give out presents and thank our hostess, Evaggelia.
<BR>   As we crowd into the apartment babbling about the wonders of Delphi, I
seize the chance to make the presentation:
<BR>   "We've had a such wonderful time in Greece ... (Translate, Miriam, and
stop improvising; this is <I>my</I> speech.) ... it's been a great experience, a
<I>religious</I> experience almost ... such that we might become followers of the
divine Apollo ... or, devotees of the Muses ... (I'm reaching for something
here. Not quite sure what it <I>is</I> yet. Harumph, begin again, Derek.)
<BR>   "Delphi was the last major archaeological site on our agenda today ... a
fitting climax ... (Miriam, for once, seems to be having trouble with the
translation, but the pauses are giving me plenty of time to wax rhetorical.)
... a high point, a summit ... (Here I draw a capital dthelta in the air and
indicate its top point. Nice graphic, but now I'm stuck with the mountain
image.) "Although this gift can never quite reach the summit of your
hospitality, Evaggelia ... (I'm remembering Olympus, perhaps?) ... it is, in
itself, a peak of another feather ... (Ooops, too late to edit that one.) ...
because I hold in my hand the very Parnassos of Canadian Wines ... (Here I
present the bottle of premium ice wine that we've lugged all the way from the
LCBO in St. Catharines.) ... which is, we hope, a fitting 'thank you' for all
you've done to help make our trip a success. (Now I fall back exhausted,
dripping sweat onto the couch.)"
<BR>   She accepts the speech with good grace. (Apollo only knows what Greek
words Miriam has, in effect, popped into her Daddy's wide open yap.) Daddy
now decides it might be prudent to buzz off like a sweat bee and take a nice
cool shower.
<BR>   Afterwards, I have a long sit on the balcony in the coolth of the evening
to meditate on the lively street life of Piraeus down below. One of us will
have to nip down to that little retsina shop on the corner and restock.

<BR><I>97-06-23 Monday</I>   We sleep in and start out for Monemvasia late to avoid the
Athenian rush hour.
<BR>For Merle and I, this will be the final excursion of our trip. A climb to the
citadel of Mystra, near Sparta, along the way. Temperature still in the 40s.
<BR>   <I>97-06-24 Tuesday</I>   We hang out in the village. Shopping in Molai, a town
nearby. Swimming at the bee research site.
<BR>   <I>97-06-25 Wednesday</I>   Monemvasia. A swim under the city walls in crystal
water amid chunks of Byzantine masonry fallen from the ramparts above. And
again, later at the research site. This could become a regular way of life.

<BR><I>97-06-26 Thursday</I>  To Omai to catch the bus. Change at Sparta for Athens.
Miriam and Dimitri stay back in the village to get on with their research.
<BR>Merle and Derek cope with Greek public transit on their own. At Corinth, the
bus driver exchanges a few punches with one of the lippier passengers.
<BR>   Met at the Athens bus station by Grigori and Evaggelia. That evening,
we're unable to confirm our flight, no Athens phone numbers. We call Canada
long distance. Press "1" for flights to Kapuskasing, "2" for flights to
Yellowknife ...
<BR>   <I>97-07-27 Friday</I>   The flight is "confirmed" (but not corroborated) this
morning for 10:55am. We set out for the airport at 7:00am with Evaggelia
driving. Hot. Endless delays, poorly explained by officialdom. Get to know
the other passengers really well.  Maybe they'll cancel the flight and we'll
be stranded a week. What a fate ... Take-off at 4:55pm -- six hours late.
Soaring up the coast of Italy by 5:30. Straight Roman roads visible from the
air. Miriam and Dimitri are probably in swimming by now.
<BR>   <I>97-06-28 Saturday</I>   Woodside Drive. My May 29th sense of foreboding is
amply confirmed -- we're back. Damn cold last night: up a 12-mile Creek, out
on a limb in the boreal forest, lost in Outer-Macedonia without any retsina,
but we sleep anyway, like two bumps on a log (or rather, like two bumps on
two logs. What I mean is, one bump on each log, giving a total of two? ...
Oh, forget it!) Disconsolate and inarticulate at the loss of sunlight, lack
of 40 degree heat, salt water and a regular diet of ruins three times a day,
we take us downtown to the St. Catharines open-air Market to comfort us with
apples, veggies, and flowers. Severely jet-lagged, but already beginning to
reminisce.

<BR>   05-02-22: edited. marked. needs picture improvements, more pictures.
<BR>   05-02-27: added, interpolated diary above. Still needs more pictures.
scan prints from photo album? Still some missing diary entries?
<BR>   07-10-10: minor edits. This is readable as an illustrated diary.
To view as manual slide show, in 1-line mode, should ideally have only
captions visible or, at most, 2-line comment beneath the/gra tag, followed
by null cmd tag "/". The text will be displayed with only one extra
keystroke. Another <pgdn> or <enter> displays the next picture. 
<BR>   In 6-line mode, a second paragraph should prob. be complete on the first
screen. This permits the reader to make sense of the text, but to skip any
extra by going to the next picture with the <f9>/<+srch> key.
<BR>   The line before the next/gra tag should prob. be null, "/", to allow for
less confusing backup in 1-line manual mode. Only the picture is displayed.
<BR>   This show was formatted with integral numbers of 6-line pages. This
allows the show text to always appear below the picture.
<BR>   07-10-11: more minor edits. Added a few/nul/*... tags to make context
clearer as we move from place to place. A diary, written in isolation from
the pictures is a different challenge than writing up an account with the
picture portfolio in front of you. Here, the pictures, if any, have to be
brought TO the text, which should be readable in its own right. With
ordinary photo portfolios, the challenge is the opposite, to insert text
between the pictures.
<BR> 08-11-29: touch-up.
<BR> 09-02-26: scanned Greeks slides again. See below.

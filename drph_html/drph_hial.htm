<BR clear='all'><P>  <B>A Child's Sense of Vocation, Vindicated in Retirement Years</B>
<BR clear='all'><P>  When I was a lad my dad wangled me a visit to the cab of a steam
locomotive standing in the CNR station of Richmond Quebec. We were on our way
from Montreal to Danville on family business. I was impressed enough by all
the pipes and gauges, the hissing steam. But when the fireman opened the
firebox door and heaved in a shovelful of coal, producing a blast of heat and
a cloud of sparks: Instant conversion and a strong desire to become an engine
driver. Shortly after this, the steam engine was replaced by the boring
diesel on most of Canada's railroads.

<BR clear='all'><P>  In elementary and high school the history of various Imperial heroes and
explorers was introduced: Clive of India, Burton, Speke. Lacking opportunites
as a locomotive driver, I decided to become an explorer. Or, perhaps, more
practically, an Imperial civil servant such as the District Commissioner of
some salubrious Pacific Island inhabited by hospitable ladies in grass
skirts. 

<BR clear='all'><P>  Not long after the war, came the announcement that the Hunt expedition,
with Hillary and Tenzing in the lead, had climbed Everest, the planet's
highest mountain. Despite the heralding of a New Elizabethan Age, the Empire
was undergoing an inexorable contraction and the oportunities for Imperial
Civil Servants, even those well-versed in Urdu or Fijian, began to dry up.

<BR clear='all'><P>  Furthermore, with the "conquering" of the last geographical challenges,
the age of exploration began a gradual slide into celebrity stunts and
endurance feats. Witness the film: "The man who skied down Mt. Everest". The
only viable alternatives left to me seemed to be scientific bean-counting or
working on National Geographic Specials. 

<BR clear='all'><P>  Then came about 4 decades of university, parenthood, under-employment and
many fascinating but unprofitable creative projects. And now, today, as a
superannuated computer programmer, unpublished novelist, and decrepit senior
citizen, the opportunities for the life of an explorer are few indeed. So
what is a person to do who long ago conceived of the meaning of life in terms
of fire-breathing engines and malaria-infested swamps?

<BR clear='all'><P>  The answer may lie in a step sideways. The real essence of exploration
lies in the conceptual nature of the experience. Discovery is not just a
matter of braving geographical hazards, or enumerating topographical facts,
but of putting together separate experiences, only sometimes geographical,
into a comprehensive idea. Creating a "gestalt", if you will, a melding of
details that will be seen to form part of a newly revealed and potentially
significant unity.

<BR clear='all'><P>  This is what I would like to convey to the viewers of these pictures. How
a high-level, bird's eye view of even familiar terrain can be, not only an
interesting and joyful experience to the peripatetic observer, but also serve
as a metaphor for awakening insights of a broader sort. Possibly even, a
modest squint into the human condition, even a Wordsworthian Intimation of
Immortality.

a lifetime of hiking.

of what a macroscopic experience
hiking high (and wide) can be.

<I>AL05-006 40-to-49</I> - <B>The Pinnacle, Danville,Que</B>

<BR clear='all'><P> My first real climbing expedition, was probably in 1946 or 1947. My dad
was visiting on a "48", a two day weekend leave from St. Hubert RCAF base on
the south shore opposite Montreal. The Shipton Township Pinnacle is located
in the Eastern Townships of Quebec near Danville. It is one of the outlying
hills of the Appalachian chain.

<BR clear='all'><P> Well prepared, I had a new pair of high,
lace-up boots and a stout rope. The experience seemed ecstatic at the time,
particularly the view from the top. But when we got down, our car had sunk
into a muddy ditch. No amount of brushwood, rocks and fence rails served to
give us traction. Using my climbing rope, doubled and re-doubled, we had to
get a smirking farmer to pull the car out with his tractor for $15.

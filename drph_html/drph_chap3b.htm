<P>    Clambering up a rocky promontory, James found a spot where
he could sit and get a view down the shore without being too
much ruffled by the breeze -- or by his own companions. A day
out from the mouth of the French River, the brigade had to camp
early due to adverse winds and a pounding surf. He hoped the
delay was not part of a pattern since he was already critical of
the way the affairs of the expedition were being managed. The
enigmatic presence of Mrs. Maidstone, so near and yet so far,
did nothing to improve his dissatisfied mood.
<P>    He took possession of a comfortable shelf on the lee side of
a cliff. At least he could sit in shelter and privately consider
the prospect. In the middle of a wilderness, it was surprisingly
difficult to find a little solitude to sort out his thoughts. He
set down sketchbook and portfolio and began laying out brushes
and paints.
<P>    At times, Captain Ames thoroughly exasperated him.
Perpetually assigning projects to tally and repack equipment,
make maps and log-books, check the men's kit and diet. Least
stimulating was the Captain's obsessive preoccupation with the
placement of latrines, well away from the habited part of any
campsite. James felt sheepish, continually reminding the men of
their leader's orders on the subject of bodily functions.
<P>    Far from being a remote supervisor, the Captain was, in
James' opinion, far too intimately concerned with the trivial
logistics of the expedition. At the same time he appeared
strangely uninterested in the overall purpose of the journey,
concentrating relentlessly on the welfare and good spirits of
the company. For their part, the men lapped it up, encouraged
it, in fact. Even if they did enjoy a private chuckle behind the
Captain's back.
<P>    To James the lack of a grand design was mildly disquieting.
Though it was difficult to fault a leader merely for showing
fatherly concern and unfailing good cheer. He found himself
deliberately adopting an attitude of inner glumness, just to
keep his balance. Like washing out the mouth with sinful whiskey
to kill the cloying taste of too much wholesome milk.
<P>    Behind him and out of sight, his companions went about their
chores. Each partook of the sparse recreations available to the
wilderness traveller. With the labour of the day completed, the
canoe men collected wood for cooking the evening meal. A repair
party heated a pot of sticky spruce gum to caulk a canoe that
had become leaky in the pounding waves. When James had taken his
leave from the group, the Captain was regaling his listeners
with robust accounts of survival in the Arctic. Fending off
polar bears and icebergs through minute attention to proper
diet. Looking back from the top of the promontory, Captain Ames'
characteristic white mop was still visible in the distance at
the centre of a group of the expedition's troopers.  
<P>    A few other listless souls had been sitting alone on the
shore. Some gazed vacantly into the offing or tossed pebbles at
the oncoming waves. A lonely figure in black was meandering down
the beach, collecting mineral specimens, perhaps, or novel forms
of aquatic life stranded along the rocks. What with the rain,
blackflies and the perpetual busyness of camp life, he could see
no practical way to pursue his aquaintance with the ravishing
Mrs. Maidstone.
<P>    James became absorbed in the progress of his sketch. He laid
down a horizon line and ticked off extreme points at either end
to represent features at the limits of the scene. Then he added
minute scribbles to show intermediate coastline details. The
placement of these, he checked against the horizon, using his
thumb on a pencil held at arm's length. The proportion seemed
about right and he began to fill in the overall profile. Then
came more details. Another promontory about three hundred yards
from where he sat. A particularly tall pine tree overtopping its
fellows. A small island in the far distance, barely
distinguishable from the coastline itself.
<P>    The trouble is, he thought, I should be sitting in a boat
offshore. This isn't what a mariner would see, unless he was
aground on the rocks. He'd made it too scenic, put too much
interest in the foreground. He sighed, but continued filling in
details.
<P>    He glared at his waves, fighting a mounting urge to crumple
the paper and toss it over the cliff. Waves were always
problematical. It was difficult to suggest water in motion
without turning it into an unsightly dog's breakfast. Or forcing
it into highly regular billows that resembled furrows in a
ploughed field. He switched his efforts to giving the white
pines their familiar shape, with dense clumps of needles like
fingers on the lee side. At least that much would be right. If
nothing else, the viewer would be able to judge the direction of
the prevailing wind. 
<P>    Now the preliminary sketch was finished. James opened his
paintbox to prepare a light wash of paint to fix the main
colours in mind for later elaboration. He noted how the water
mirrored the blue sky right up to the fringe of foam round the
shoreline.  Here were none of those muddy brown edges shown by
Lake Ontario after a storm. He gave the spruce foliage a dark
green with patches of yellow for the new spring growth of the
hardwood shrubs.
<P>    The rocks were more of a problem. Though mainly orange-brown
in colour, some were densely covered with lichens. On the closer
slabs he couldn't decide whether to try for a speckled effect or
simply to wash-in areas of darker colour. The chasm between his
visual impressions of the scene and his artistic realization of
them was proving maddeningly difficult to bridge.
<P>    "Try a touch of purple in the burnt umber." The liquid voice
seemed to cascade down on him from somewhere on high. "Dampen
the paper and let it spread a little."
<P>    He twisted round, nearly upsetting his water bottle. A neat
black boot was planted on the rock behind his head. Above the
boot, a wind-blown swirl of dark fabric round a thigh and Mrs.
Maidstone commanding the heights.
<P>    "<I>You</I> seem to have found a snug refuge. May I climb down
and join you?" Without waiting for an answer, she made her way
to where James sat. "You've succeeded in locating the most
beautiful prospect in the district." 
<P>    He was on his feet clutching the still-damp sketch. "I'm
afraid there's nothing to sit on. ... I've been trying to do a
shoreline profile." He turned it for her to see. "... What d'you
think of it?" She examined the sketch.
<P>    "I'm afraid you'll never get it into the <I>Admiralty Pilot of
the Upper Lakes</I>. Altogether too pleasant. Not enough
information about bearings and soundings."
<P>     They laughed together. James looked back at the picture and
began to see it in a new light. It was the warm glow of a
drawing room lamp, rather than the dim lantern-light of a ship's
cabin. He smiled at his own handiwork for the first time since
he'd begun, then at her. 
<P>    "I <I>was</I> having a little trouble with the lichens," he
admitted.
<P>    She knelt beside him and seized the paint box. While he
watched, she deftly mixed a light wash of colour. Leaning past
him, she applied it to the corner of a rock in the unfinished
part of the sketch.
<P>    "I'll just do a bit. You can go over it again if you like.
D'you see it?  There really <I>is</I> a purple colour on those brown
rocks, particularly in the shadows. Look, right beside you, and
on the rock behind you." She floated a finger past his face and
lingeringly touched the stones beside his head. "It's not merely
an illusion of distance. ... You can see the same colour right
here where we're sitting ... just you and I." 
<P>    James' own colour deepened at her nearness, but he tried to
concentrate on the art lesson. "... I think you're right about
the purple.  Do you paint yourself?  I mean, do you, yourself,
paint?" 
<P>    She smiled playfully. "Why yes, I suppose any woman does her
share of self-portraiture -- back in civilization in front of a
mirror. But I have done a fair bit of landscape." She peered
again at the sketch, then beamed at James. "Interesting
discussion topic, landscape. We soon get beyond mere technique,
and move toward perilous topics like: 'The Picturesque'. Until I
embarked on this voyage, I'd always thought of landscape in
fairly restricted terms. Things like cattle grazing in peaceful
meadows, or country churchyards at dusk. Faced by treed hills and
endless rocky coastlines, I now see that the subject goes far
beyond mere sentiment." 
<P>    "Not much of that up here." James sincerely wished he could
have thought of some more original comment to impress her
with. "Peaceful meadows, that is."
<P>    She sat down against the sheltering rock and stared at him
with chin pillowed on knees, arms clasping skirts to her ankles.
After an awkward meeting of eyes, she raised her head and
prompted:
<P>    "Do continue, you needn't take my advice seriously. I only
meant the purple as a suggestion."
<P>    James turned silently back to his sketch and resumed
washing-in the rock with purple. He was very conscious that Mrs.
Maidstone was following his every movement as she spoke.
<P>    "Years ago, I had a sketching master. But we always kept to
churchyards and cottage gardens, polite subjects.  I really
wanted to do dramatic subjects, like Benjamin West: ships at sea,
armies clashing by night. Eventually, I ended up doing scenery
painting in a theatre in New York. But, back home, young ladies
of good breeding and rural upbringing seldom encountered ships
and armies in their normal travels. ... Surrounded by hedges of
country squires, you know."
<P>    Fascinating, he thought, but what was all this in aid of.
She seemed to be leading up to something. James pretended to be
absorbed in his brushstrokes while she rambled on.
<P>    "... Country squires! Now there's a class of gentleman who
would as soon hang pictures of steeplechases or prize cattle in
the library as anything else. No sense of art for art's sake.
... So eventually I bolted for freedom -- when I had the chance
to run off overseas to visit colonial relatives. Ended up
getting stuck in the colonies during the war."
<P>    "... My father and mother come from the Old Country. ... but
I was born in Kingston." The latter remark came out sounding a
little regretful.
<P>    James tried to keep his mind on the problem of achieving a
foam effect at the edge of the rocks. But a splendid wave
diverted him, surging in to meet the land, inundating the higher
shore and insinuating itself into a thousand crannies among the
stones. Mrs. Maidstone was beginning to insinuate herself into a
thousand crannies in his mind. She looked at him expectantly.
His turn to say something clever.
<P>    "So, I-I take it you were brought up in the English countryside,
then? Er, rather than in the city?" Why did everything he said
have such an obvious, <I>limping</I> quality. She <I>had</I> said: "young
ladies of good breeding and rural upbringing."
<P>    "Yes, but I did find the ships and armies, soon enough.
Coming out to the colonies has been rather strenuous, what with
the war. Do you ever paint things like that -- battles, forts
and cannons? You're from Kingston, you'd have plenty of
subjects. Fortifications all about, warships in the harbour?" 
<P>    "I'm inclined to leave the details, such as the exact slope
of a glacis or the location of a redoubt, to my father. He's the
expert in fortification. My current passion is br... er,
shoreline profiles."
<P>    He bit his lip, inwardly squirming while he feathered the
edge of a pine tree into a damp sky. He'd nearly referred to a
portion of Mrs. Maidstone's own profile that had agreeably
intercepted his vision. 
<P>    The lady seemed disappointed that he displayed no special
interest in military subjects.
<P>    "Unfortunately, the trouble with wild landscape is that --
unless you find some horrendous peak or frightful chasm -- the
general mess of rocks and blasted pine trees is pretty close to
... <I>meaningless</I>." James looked at his sketch with a frown,
then at her. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean your sketch in
particular. Country churchyards and prize cattle may be boring,
but they're the sort of thing anyone can make sense of.  Out on
the frontier, life is too strenuous to be boring. But Nature
itself is twisted -- jumbled and chaotic. It has nothing to do
with historical drama or with recogniseable human desires." 
<P>    He looked up from his sketch to a distant speck barely
distinguishable from the coastline. He could imagine pulling up
his canoe on that island, building a fire, recouping his
strength. Next day, they would press on toward yet another misty
landfall somewhere even further down the coast. <I>They</I> would
press on, errant thought. He looked back at his sketch and
dabbed a fleck of colour where the air and water met the land. A
deliberate uncertainty in the meeting between the elements. A
potential for new experience that drew the eye onward toward the
empty horizon. He considered the effect, and decided it was not
a mistake. 
<P>    For the first time since he'd met the penetrating Mrs.
Maidstone, he was aware that he'd just glimpsed some vision of
Art, and perhaps Life itself, that would probably be quite
surprising to her. He wasn't exactly sure how to express it.
Impulsively, he took her hand and looked into her eyes that now
showed a flicker of uncertainty.
<P>    "The best wilderness landscapes, Madam, are those that
invite the traveller rather than the settler. What is confused
and useless to the country squire, may present a life-giving
opportunity to the wayfarer, or to the wandering Indian. We must
learn to see again through <I>aboriginal</I> eyes ..." He almost
growled the word. Then he kissed the curving fingers and
devoured her with his own intent gaze. Slowly releasing her
hand, he began collecting his painting things.
<P>    "I do believe it's finished." He placed the sketch, now
almost dry, in his portfolio. "Let's hope that Mr. Harris has
reserved a comfortable rock for sitting at dinner. Perhaps you
and your husband will join the expedition staff for pemmican
stew?"
<P>    As they strolled back to camp, James' life as a
stores-tallying, latrine-supervising junior officer seemed
briefly to take on a new dimension. The spacious horizon rolled
westward once again, revealing countless idyllic islands where he
and his muse could rest from their wandering. Wondrous landfalls
where they might pitch a solitary camp and map out the next leg
of life's journey, together.

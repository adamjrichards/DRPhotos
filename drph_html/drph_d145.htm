<BR><P><B>Montreal for Passover.</B>
<BR><I>04-12 Wednesday.</I>  We fly to Montreal for Passover. Drive to Hamilton airport
and park. Dp. 11:45am, arr. 5:15pm, 5.5hrs. Cost, $800, return fare for 2.
Compare 8-9hrs by car, door-to-door. 750mi at $0.75/mile, approx. $500.
<BR>
<BR><I>04-13 Thursday</I>.  The rites and rituals of Passover, observed. 3-4-5 glasses
of wine. A much edited and abridged service. Kids running everywhere. We skip
the plagues of Egypt. Our generation may have a less ferocious mentality than
our ancestors, who were apparently inclined to chortle with naive delight
whenever our "enemies" got justly whacked, and then to moan "Why me, O Lord?"
when we were the ones to suffer unlooked-for reverses.

established, hilly, mausoleums and obelisks. A large one commemorating the
battle of Ste. Eustache with a list of patriots transported to the Antipodes.

<BR>On the Metro, going home. Advert for a dating service in the background.
<BR>
<BR><I>04-15 Saturday</I>  A trip to the market in the morning. Young Sasha a loose
cannon, forever wandering off and reaching for forbidden fruit. Needs a leash
or stroller to pin him down to a predictable location. But apparently
permissiveness is more the order of the day in 2006. People might think a
leash sadistic, but we got away with it in the 60s. Ask Nathan, he was about
Sasha's age back then.
<BR>
<BR>Nat consents to drive us to Dorval airport anyway. Flight above the clouds,
views of Lake Simcoe, Burlington Bay, and QEW skyway while approching Mt.
Hope airport. The "Skyway" seems like a joke from 3000m altitude with tiny
cars crawling across the bridge, flea-like.

<BR>
<BR>Back from Montreal. B.B.Mtn, video in evening. "What's it take to get your
attention, cowboy? A mating call?" This really is a milestone, not just
because it's a gay movie, but a mainstream gay movie. One where the viewer,
whatever their own orientation, has to take the characters seriously for the
details of their personal relationships.
<BR>
<BR><I>April 16, Sunday</I>  AIA lecture at Brock. Origins of Celtic identity. Starting
from Greek and Roman writers up to modern times. Best Powerpoint show in a
long time. Pot Luck afterwards at the Brown's in N.O.T.L. A garrulous cleric,
holding forth in the sun room, debunks my favourite book of late. Cleopatra
by Fletcher. Seems her identification of C's mummy is not upheld by many
other archaelogists. Also, she has offended the Egyptian Antquities
Department by publishing unsubstantiated claims without permission. I later
check this out on the net and find similar reservations on the AIA site. Just
goes to prove that noisy, irritating people can sometimes be quite correct in
their views. However, I think I had him for a moment with my enthusiasm for
"How the Irish saved Civilization." In this book, which has interesting takes
on the Decline of the Roman Empire, Augustine is put forward as the real
inventor of the literary ego. That is, the self-revealing memoir. No one in
the room could think of a comparable earlier work. And my accent, aided by
several thimblefuls of the Brown's sherry, grew ever more Oirish. Hope
Patrick Davies didn't notice, he can impersonate real
bog-trotting rustics.
<BR>
<BR><I>April 18, Tuesday</I>  Finalize our wills this morning at Muratori, et al. Many
signatures. Derek to the Glenridge Quarry after lunch to gaze out over the
scene and write in his notebook. Could be a weather station on the summit:
cool and steady breezes prevail up there. Lots of sky.
<BR>
<BR><I>April 21, Friday</I>  Saw <I>Paradise Now</I> at the Welland Film Society last
night. The story of two suicide bombers seen from the Palestinian POV. 
<I>Water</I> by Deepa Mehta the night before last. Have had our fill of depressing
movies lately. P.N. a "great" film, partly because of the serious theme. But
also because you don't have to agree with the programme of the suicide
bombers to realize this is a significant insight into their sense of
grievance and futility. Only by <I>death</I> and martyrdom can they keep their own
and Palestinian identity <I>alive</I>. Italics all over the place -- did not sleep
well last night.
<BR>
<BR>And look at me: an underwhelming urge to document the Picturesque, to chart
the better-known corners of the known universe. To fill notebooks with
low-level wit. Not even an artist. A mere <I>Vidutist</I>. Hark! ( or Behold!) The
title of a picture has just popped into my head: <I>Two sides of the same
coign.</I> Now to find some architectural details that fit.

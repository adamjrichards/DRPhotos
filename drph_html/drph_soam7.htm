<I>D226-389 09-06-20</I> - <B>Late afternoon shadows.</B><xxx>

<BR>Late afternoon. Again the constant problem of mountain photography. The top
of the picture tends to be overexposed and the lower, underexposed.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-390.jpeg">
<I>D226-390 09-06-20</I> - <B>Standout Peak.</B><xxx>

<BR>The tooth in the middle seems like a kind of symbol of some sort of unique
event in geological history. But I suppose it's just an accident of the
current cloud configuration.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-390A.jpeg">
<I>D226-390A V11-10-10</I> - <B>Standout peak FX</B><xxx>

<BR>This comes close to abstract, but for me, the effect works because it uses
less information to evoke the same or even an enhanced idea of the original
context. I suspect there's a kind of leverage effect at work here. Maximum
evocation with minimal stimulus. The mind gets a thrill when a penny in the
slot gets an overflowing handful of higher denomination associations.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-392.jpeg">
<I>D226-392 09-06-20</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Distant snow clad peaks and a hanging glacier. I'm wistful. But our route
isn't taking us in that direction. And I suppose we wouldn't have the energy
to climb that high anyway.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/d230/d230-188.jpeg">
<I>d230-188 09-06-20</I> - <B>Carole D: The whole gang.</B><xxx>

<BR>Our last night on the trail. This is our farewell to the porters and chef.
Angelo takes the picture. A last supper for our group. We make speeches.
Everyone introduces themselves and gives a brief sketch of their lives before
the Inca Trail. A little backsheesh is handed out, and we retire for the
night.
<BR><P><B>June 21 Day 4.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-394.jpeg">
<I>D226-394 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The morning of our last day we're wakened at 4:30am. We stumble around the
crowded campground in the dark, looking for toilets and breakfast. Then we
head for the exit where we stand in line in the dark with headlamps glowing.
There we wait at a closed gate monitored by a parks official till we can be
released to stampede down the trail toward Machu Picchu.
<BR> This formality is to prevent people from attacking the trail too early and
either falling off a cliff in the near total darkness, or arriving at the
site before opening time. Or, perhaps, they want us to get there at just the
right psychological moment. Nobody seems to know exactly what's going on.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-395.jpeg">
<I>D226-395 09-06-21</I> - <B>Up at 4:30 am.</B><xxx>

<BR>Beyond the camp exit we walk with our headlamps still on, to keep from
falling into the abyss on the right. It's too dark for photography so these
are all hand-held time exposures. But there ARE signs of the sun coming up
behind us.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-397.jpeg">
<I>D226-397 09-06-21</I> - <B>The Urubamba R. again.</B><xxx>

<BR>The Urubamba River is again visible below. Eventually we'll make the descent
down to its banks.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-399.jpeg">
<I>D226-399 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Getting a bit lighter now.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-401.jpeg">
<I>D226-401 09-06-21</I> - <B>Nearing Aguas Calientes.</B><xxx>

<BR>This is the outskirts of Aguas Calientes. The town is somewhere round the
bend. That mountain on the left jumps up from the streets of the town. You
can see the glow of streetlights below. We'll be heading left across the
mountain to approach the Machu Picchu site.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-402.jpeg">
<I>D226-402 09-06-21</I> - <B>Another ruin. Me, not her.</B><xxx>

<BR>One of the last ruins we visit along the way. Angelo gives us an interpretive
lecture.
<P><B>Jun 21 Day 4, Machu Picchu, First views.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-403.jpeg">
<I>D226-403 09-06-21</I> - <B>From Intipunku, the Sun Gate.</B><xxx>

<BR>Finally we reach Inti-punku, the Sun Gate, overlooking the site. We mill
around waiting for the sun to come up. That switchback road is where the tour
buses come up from the town and railroad station far below.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-404.jpeg">
<I>D226-404 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>We wait for the clouds to dissipate and for the hike to resume. All the
hikers are assembled here, anticipating the dramatic moment. At the bottom
left is the bus terminal and assembly area with a snack bar and even a small
hotel.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-405.jpeg">
<I>D226-405 09-06-21</I> - <B>Bus route up from town.</B><xxx>

<BR>You can see an early tour bus labouring up the hill on one of the lower
switchbacks.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-407.jpeg">
<I>D226-407 09-06-21</I> - <B>She made it!</B><xxx>

<BR>It's all downhill from here Merle. We've here and we're going to witness
the final revelation in a few minutes.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-410.jpeg">
<I>D226-410 09-06-21</I> - <B>We wait for the sun god to show up.</B><xxx>

<BR>Shreds of cloud snag onto these improbable peaks surrounding the site and the
town. It reminds me of some place in China where similar peaks are often
pictured sticking up out of an eternal mist.
<BR>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-411.jpeg">
<I>D226-411 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>It seems that the clouds actually cling to these high rocks. Perhaps the air
currents eddy round them before going on to the next stop.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-413.jpeg">
<I>D226-413 09-06-21</I> - <B>The clouds disperse.</B><xxx>

<BR>The last of the clouds have cleared and the sun is now well down the
mountainside. Still the hikers wait. This is one of those moments, sacred to
the treking crowd, like experiencing dawn on Mount Kilimanjaro. We got
<I>there</I> at 3pm, missing the dawn, but DID have perfect conditions for
photography. This time we have both the dawn <I>and</I> ideal conditions for
photography.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-414.jpeg">
<I>D226-414 09-06-21</I> - <B>The sun creeps down Huayna Picchu, rt.</B><xxx>

<BR>That illuminated rock on the right. This, we're told, is also accessible to
hikers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-415.jpeg">
<I>D226-415 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>There's actually an archaeological site at the top of the rock. As you can
see from the agricultural terraces on the very peak.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-416.jpeg">
<I>D226-416 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The sun is just touching the top of the main altar on the Machu Picchu site.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-417.jpeg">
<I>D226-417 09-06-21</I> - <B>Sun on the high altar.</B><xxx>

<BR>Almost as if this was contrived somehow by a graphics special effects
coordinator. Now we know the reason for the line-up to leave camp this
morning. They were attempting to time our arrival at the Sun Gate so we could
witness this matchless scene.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-418.jpeg">
<I>D226-418 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The sun is a little further down. I'm getting antsy. The suspense is almost
unbearable, but everyone knows exactly what is going to happen. It's like
watching a familiar drama. It's not that you wonder <I>what's</I> going to happen.
You want to witness again <I>how</I> it happens, so you can savour the details.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-420.jpeg">
<I>D226-420 09-06-21</I> - <B>The full illumination.</B><xxx>

<BR>At last. Now we're almost ready to depart and make our own entry to the
site. Our trail leads down that shelf to the left.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-421.jpeg">
<I>D226-421 09-06-21</I> - <B>We feel illuminated too.</B><xxx>

<BR>Like a curtain opening on a stage production. I'm glad we came this way
rather than on a tour bus from below. Our experience is a compound, not only
of the visual aspects of the scene, but also includes a visceral awareness of
the effort needed to get here, plus all our trail experiences. A kind of 4-day
morality play for hikers, with an added dash of the Olde Tyme Religion.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-423.jpeg">
<I>D226-423 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Merle, you made it. You were the chief instigator of this project in the
Richards household. You survived moments when our plans seemed
questionable, financially and logistically. Now you're totally vindicated.
<BR>The Sun God has made an appearance.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-425.jpeg">
<I>D226-425 09-06-21</I> - <B>The Sun-god gives a blessing.</B><xxx>

<BR>Bright rays beam down on us lesser mortals trudging around on the face of
the earth below. Headlamps are no longer needed. We are thoroughly
illuminated.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-426.jpeg">
<I>D226-426 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The Urubamba River, deep down in the valley. And the Machu Picchu Railroad. I
can see some railroad cars over on the left.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-428.jpeg">
<I>D226-428 09-06-21</I> - <B>Final descent.</B><xxx>

<BR>This is the trail down, bearing to the left. The agricultural terraces are
our introduction to the site. Then we walk down a side path to those
green-roofed buildings where the official entrance to the site is located.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-430.jpeg">
<I>D226-430 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>More bomeliads. Samples of the plant life at this altitude.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-436.jpeg">
<I>D226-436 09-06-21</I> - <B>Pachamama altar on the path down.</B><xxx>

<BR>A last stop on the way down. The Pachamama altar, to the Earth Goddess. This
is one impressive rock.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-437.jpeg">
<I>D226-437 09-06-21</I> - <B>Derek's offering: 4 coca leaves.</B><xxx>

<BR>Derek has to leave an offering. He parts with some of the coca leaves he's
been chewing to relieve the stresses of the trail. At Angelo, the guide's
suggestion (or warning), he puts down <I>four</I> leaves, one for each point of the
compass. This will ensure protection in any direction that he decides to
roam. The goddess might have deemed a single leaf to be stingy and confining.
<BR>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-439.jpeg">
<I>D226-439 09-06-21</I> - <B>A hiker holy place.</B><xxx>

<BR>Apparently this is a spot that many other hikers have found impressive. There
are these little rock monuments all over the place.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-440.jpeg">
<I>D226-440 09-06-21</I> - <B>Dedicated to the Earth Goddess.</B><xxx>

<BR>That's a nice piece of rock, Merle. We had a kosher butcher once, in the
Kensington Market, who had a memorable way of saying: "Mr. Richards, dots a
nize piece of mit, you're buyink today." This rock too deserves to be put
into the archival freezer of my permanent Rockscape portfolio.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-442.jpeg">
<I>D226-442 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Japanese hikers. They too seemed to find the site impressive.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-451.jpeg">
<I>D226-451 09-06-21</I> - <B>On the edge of the site.</B><xxx>

<BR>And finally, we reach the very edge of the archaelogical site. The picture
is taken by Angelo who is about to give us an orientation lecture. On
Derek's left are two new members of our group who have come up from
the town below.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-444.jpeg">
<I>D226-444 09-06-21</I> - <B>Now for some serious archaelogy.</B><xxx>

<BR>The site was probably covered at the time of discovery by the kind of brush
you see at the right. Today, many of the buildings seem to lack only roof
thatching. Visiting the sites of classical Mediterranean antiquity, you get
used to ruins with only the bare lower courses of foundations showing. But
the buildings in front of us are from the 16th century, one to two thousand
years later.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-447.jpeg">
<I>D226-447 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Looking toward the back of the site. The main altar is just in front of that
small spire of rock.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-454.jpeg">
<I>D226-454 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>As we're approaching the site, a few alpacas or lamas are visible grazing in
the far end of the inner courtyard.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-455.jpeg">
<I>D226-455 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Here's a building that's had its thatched roof reinstated. We enter to check
out Inca roofing procedures.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-461.jpeg">
<I>D226-461 09-06-21</I> - <B>Inca roofing technique 101.</B><xxx>

<BR>Illustrates the kind of technology required to work without nails or
shingles. Everything is tied together with rope.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-463.jpeg">
<I>D226-463 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>We continue our walk behind Angelo.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-466.jpeg">
<I>D226-466 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Along this pathway leading to the inner part of the site. Past these rows of
what look like residential buildings.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-467.jpeg">
<I>D226-467 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>This may have been a moat or a water channel separating the agricultural
terraces from the more built-up areas.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-472.jpeg">
<I>D226-472 09-06-21</I> - <B>The guardhouse.</B><xxx>

<BR>The so-called guard house at the top of the hill. We don't know if it was
really a guard house but this is how it's referred to in the tourist
literature. On the right, some of the site's heavier stonework.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-473.jpeg">
<I>D226-473 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>You can see how the Incas seemed to respect the mountain base that the city
is constructed on. They dovetailed their own construction carefully into
the underlying rock.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-474.jpeg">
<I>D226-474 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Has an organic quality that's more than simply a matter of skilfully
carving corners and edges. They seemed to have a veneration for the mountain
terrain they lived in.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-477.jpeg">
<I>D226-477 09-06-21</I> - <B>An altar carved from living rock.</B><xxx>

<BR>This altar illustrates the point. The altar itself has been carved out of
the underlying rock of the moutain. The Inca fill-in has been inserted very
smoothly and elegantly.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-479.jpeg">
<I>D226-479 09-06-21</I> - <B>Agri terraces. Our inbound path visible.</B><xxx>

<BR>Looking back to the Inti Punku, the Sun Gate. You can see our trail coming
diagonally down the mountain side from the notch. The Pachamama altar is also
visible. In the foreground are some of the main agricultural terraces.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-480.jpeg">
<I>D226-480 09-06-21</I> - <B>Guardhouse. Machu Picchu Mt. in back.</B><xxx>

<BR>The guardhouse again. The mountain on the left is actually Mount Machu
Picchu. Nobody knows what the name of the site itself might have been, but
it has picked up the name of the mountain by default.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-482.jpeg">
<I>D226-482 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>More elegant stonework, with doorways that usually taper slightly toward the
top.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-483.jpeg">
<I>D226-483 09-06-21</I> - <B>This is how they split the rock.</B><xxx>

<BR>Angelo explains how they split the rock without the equipment we take for
granted today. Locating the cleavage planes, holes were chiselled and wooden
wedges inserted. These, when wetted, would then crack the rock along the
cleavage plane. So if you knew and respected the nature of the rock, you could
accomplish what would otherwise take an awful lot of brute force hacking.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-486.jpeg">
<I>D226-486 09-06-21</I> - <B>Over there!, See that?</B><xxx>

<BR>No! over to your left ...
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-484.jpeg">
<I>D226-484 09-06-21</I> - <B>Derek profile, foreseen by the Incas.</B><xxx>

<BR>I couldn't help noticing this hairy-headed profile staring up meditatively
into the clouds. It aroused a modest thrill of recognition in this particular
viewer. But Derek didn't seem amused when I told him about it.
<BR><P><A NAME="fault"> tab=fault</A>
<BR>

<BR>kwd: fault, plate, tectonic. profile, masonry, crack, gap
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-487.jpeg">
<I>D226-487 09-06-21</I> - <B>Altar straddling a fault line.</B><xxx>

<BR>One of the only signs of geological damage. It was pointed out by Angelo that
there might be a fault line running throught the site. But this was the only
place where we could see anything more than minor shifts in the masonry of
the ancient Incas.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-488.jpeg">
<I>D226-488 09-06-21</I> - <B>Same altar, left.</B><xxx>

<BR>To the left of that very same point, the stonework is perfectly intact. It
seems that the only thing that has been able to distress the Inca masonry is
a major shift in the underlying plates.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-489.jpeg">
<I>D226-489 09-06-21</I> - <B>The high altar.</B><xxx>

<BR>The crowds were so tremendous on the day we arrived that we decide to
postpone our visit to this altar till tomorrow.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-490.jpeg">
<I>D226-490 09-06-21</I> - <B>Interior courtyard.</B><xxx>

<BR>We carry on around the site to see everything we can. Someone has commented
that they found the site "sterile". It does have an almost too-well
manicured look, especially when you compare it to the mess that appears in
some of Hiram Bingham's pictures. Hiram Bingham was the first archaeologist
to visit the site.
<BR>
<BR>  Fresh from the relative isolation of the trail I find that the site does
have an almost uncanny "recently deserted" quality. Like some town that has
been abandoned with very little sign of damage to explain the desertion. A
few movies, whose titles I can't remember, have exploited this unexplained,
deserted quality. Contact me if you can recall their names.
<P><A href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=deserted city"> websrch:deserted city</A>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-493.jpeg">
<I>D226-493 09-06-21</I> - <B>Not Inca horticulture.</B><xxx>

<BR>Probably just something that's taken root accidently. But it does provide
another haymisch domestic touch.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-494.jpeg">
<I>D226-494 09-06-21</I> - <B>Back, baack, a little farther ...</B><xxx>

<BR>Finally, we decide that it's time for a rest and head to the site's bus stop
and a ride down into the town. We didn't even consider walking down. Too
anticlimactic, too boring, too noisy with roaring tour buses. We're
really highlanders at heart.

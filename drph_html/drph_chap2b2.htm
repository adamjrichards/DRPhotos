<P>    The company now turned to study the matter of the Fielding
visit -- the possible threat of fresh American initiatives in
the Northwest as revealed by Colonel Enright's correspondence
with the War Department. Major Dall was attempting to make
himself heard:
<P>    "... Gentlemen, the boundary of the Hudson's Bay Company
territory extends south of the 49th parallel at the Red River
Basin and north of this line, so we are told, in the Missouri
watershed further west. I suggest we simply allow Colonel
Enright to verify the exact location of this perfectly good
natural boundary, at no cost to the Crown." 
<P>    The Governor pointedly ignored Major Dall's opinions, then
went on to say much the same thing himself. But the evident snub
went at least part way to giving James a sense of his own
vindication. He tried to listen attentively to His Excellency's
views, but he was really more interested in the Great Plains,
the Indians and the wild animals than in hypothetical boundary
lines.
<P>    "The threat, if any," said the Governor, "is basically
political rather than military. And furthermore, no grounds
exist for me to request His Majesty's Government in London to
make outraged representations to Washington. In all likelihood,
the matter will be forgotten in the time it takes to get a
return mail across the Atlantic. And in any case, as soon as
Colonel Enright cools his heels in the Pacific, he'll be looking
up the guns of some roving British man-o-war. We can be quite
positive the man is a practical fellow, whatever his table
manners. What harm can he conceivably do before he is compelled
to pack up his rag-tag enterprise and march the whole distance back
east all over again?"
<P>    The company tittered politely, but there were a few straight
faces, among them Captain Fielding's.
<P>    "Quite right, Your Excellency. The navy will, no doubt,
patrol the Pacific coastline at widely separated intervals. But
their supply lines are almost too extended to maintain a
permanent presence. And from the landward side a significant
pressure for overland expansion already exists. The western fur
trade has recently become a cut-throat enterprise. Add to that
the prize of future trade with the Sandwich Islands, Japan and
Russia.
<P>     "Sir, we have recently concluded a war, simply to prevent
annexation of British territory north of the lakes. The
Americans will now seek outlets to the west. Should they not be
forestalled at the Lakehead, it is likely that the Red River
country, Assiniboia and all of the Columbia and New Caledonia
territories will eventually fall to their advance. Gentlemen,
you must be aware of the growing mood of expansion west of the
Allegheny Mountains. Steamboats bearing settlers will soon be
ascending the Missouri from St. Louis ..." 
<P>    "Tut," interrupted the Governor, "next thing, you'll have us
turning out the garrison. It's the job of the Hudson's Bay fur
traders to maintain order in the Northwest. I daresay they can
cope with a few competitors from New York and Montreal. Keep
the aborigines civil with a blanket or two. Furthermore, we've
no detachments west of Lake Huron. Even those we have on that
lake and Erie are difficult enough to maintain." 
<P>    "But the fur traders have purely mercantile interests, Your
Excellency. They are presently embroiled in a ruinous
competition. Neither the Nor'westers nor the Hudson's Bay
Company have the desire or the capacity to provide the region
with any real administration or defence. Why, even Thompson's
excellent maps are little more than canoe routes to the trapping
grounds of the beaver. We know nothing of the agricultural or
defensive possibilities of the country, little about its
aboriginal inhabitants. And they <I>prefer</I> us to know nothing.
The area is a vacuum, largely ignored in the Canadas, but not
unmarked by the friends of Jefferson."
<P>    The room had gone silent in the face of these strongly
expressed words. The Captain had a moment to inhale deeply and
gather his forces for the final assault.
<P>    "Surely, gentlemen, British claims could be greatly
strengthened by a few more permanent outposts. At the Lakehead, and
on the Red River. Even a modest survey expedition would serve to
establish clearer title. Better to show the flag in peacetime,
when a token force could easily succeed, than be compelled to
send an army later on."
<P>    Captain Fielding's moustaches twitched and he sat down
heavily, somewhat red-faced at the vehemence of his own views. 
<P>    "Heah, heah," cried a self-assured voice, applauding alone
with slow dignity. "Captain Fielding is quite correct."
<P>    A soberly dressed, elderly person with weatherbeaten
complexion, bearing no trace of rank stood up. Wide-set eyes
peered from beneath a thatch of grey, subjecting everyone to
senatorial review. But the man's movements were hardly elderly
as he paced briskly forward, head bowed, hands clasped behind
his back. The company fell silent when he stuck out his chin.
Even the Governor unknotted his brow to peer at the speaker.
<P>    "The Admiralty must consider strategic matters from a global
perspective. Has to. England couldn't survive as she is today
without constant attention to the needs of widely separated
fleets. And to the maintenance of remote naval depots and the
intervening lines of communication. I have suggested to Lord
Bathurst -- and I may add that the Regent has expressed a keen
interest -- that we stand to reap considerable benefit from
creating a secure corridor across the North American
continent. This would greatly assist the
coordination of naval strategy on two oceans. Help provide for
the refitting and even the construction of ships operating in
the Pacific. Until a Northwest Passage is discovered, if ever,
the distances separating England from the North Pacific are
effectively planetary. Therefore, the maintenance of such a
remote depot must inevitably require local support. Shipbuilding
timber and provisioning for instance, not to mention landward
defence. This, by the way, would be far more credible if
supported in depth by inland detachments, if only to provide
early warning of movements from the east.
<P>    "Your own interests within these colonies yearly expand
westward, round the northern periphery of the lakes. Can you
picture the effect on your affairs, if the United States of
America sat upon the Northwest frontier as she now does upon the
Ohio? In recent memory, that entire territory, and the upper
Mississippi, have been snatched away from you. Mark my words,
you will not long hold the far shore of Superior when the
citizens of the Republic navigate the Red River.
<P>    "Surely you must be aware of the latest rumours. Selkirk's
colony is a tinder-box. The opportunists will be quick to
exploit any weakness in that quarter. Your intrepid Montreal fur
traders, should they be outflanked, will immediately abandon
Fort William and beg for mercy on the other side. And then the
Americans moving up the Missouri, and the Russians, emerging
from their Alaskan strongholds, will have us in a <I>pincers</I> grip
..." 
<P>    "My Lord! ... in all respect," interrupted the Governor,
"what you imply would give this administration responsibility
for several million more square miles of wilderness. And you,
Fielding, d'you think you could fortify the 49th parallel all
the way to the Rockies? Why, it would take the Great Wall of
China to restrain even the buffalo herds, let alone the
Americans."
<P>    His Lordship the mysterious stranger seemed not in the least
twitted by the Governor's outburst. James, for one, was keenly
attentive. Here was a man who, like Captain Fielding, proposed
action. Someone who would deliver them from further Sackets
Harbor and Plattsburgh fiascos, but not merely by swearing off
active struggle.
<P>    "Indeed, sir, no one would venture to suggest that you dig a
trench all the way to the Pacific and line it with troops,
standing shoulder-to-shoulder. Rather, that the authorities of
British North America, at the very least, should make themselves
fully aware of the issues of westward expansion. And that others
should <I>see</I> that they are aware. D'you take my meaning,
gentlemen? You cannot even be suspected, let alone <I>seen</I> to be
seriously interested, without at least a few reconnaissance
agents or political officers on the ground. I have to inform you
that there are those who are already taking a keen interest in
these matters. And who will stop at nothing short of success or
disaster." At this he took a healthy sip of the Governor's
brandy and sat down. 
<P>    "That was Admiral Fisher. Supposed to be retired, but I very
much doubt it," whispered Captain Fielding. "Toured the States
incognito this summer. The old boy has decided opinions, and
some high-level friends. Pokes his nose into everything. Sure to
ruffle a few feathers. A charter member of the Society for the
Diffusion of Geographical Knowledge in London, I'm told. Met him
once, in Kingston, right after I escaped from Plattsburgh. Here,
let me introduce you."
<P>    The Admiral was more hale and hearty than you might expect
from his grizzled pate and weatherbeaten face. He still gave a
handshake that made the fingers smart. A flicker in the depths
of those eyes suggested something wide-ranging and elusive. A
glimpse of fast ships, hull-down and beating to windward on a
far horizon. James experienced a sudden desire to abscond, to be
an associate of the Admiral's, even a humble crew member.
Perhaps the army wasn't the right place for him after all.
<P>    "This is Midshipman Harris," said the Admiral. "We are both
on the beach, touring the colonies for want of better
employment." The young gentleman with him inclined his head
slightly and offered his hand.
<P>    "How d'you do," said he very formally.
<P>    "I understand you're about to join a British regiment,"
continued the Admiral. "Pity we couldn't have 'pressed you into
the Navy. But never mind, not enough ships to go round. For the
time being, Mr. Harris will be attached to the
Commander-in-chief's Montreal staff. Do tell me about your
encounters with Colonel Enright. ... Ah, I see your new Colonel
is hoisting signal flags."
<P>    "Gentlemen, if you please ... before we break up," called
out a commanding voice above the buzz of conversation. "In my
official capacity, I should like to recommend Mr. James Fielding
to your company. He will be joining the 49th Regiment of Foot
with the rank of ensign. For the time being, he will be seconded
to the C.I.C.'s staff in Montreal. Good evening to you all."

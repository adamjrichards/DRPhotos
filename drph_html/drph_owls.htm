<I>owls </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>These scans were made with an early black and white
hand-scanner. Same time period as the Temple Tikvah bulletin.
Oddly, most of the pictures were on a kitchen hot pad. The
artist or owner of the copyright is unknown.
<BR>The Owl Show is                  
Derek's first purely <I>digital</I> slide show.  Other early slide shows
originated from 35mm slide projector collections.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL1.jpeg">
<I>OWL1 </I> - <B>Barred Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Barred owl is forever debarred from polite society. No one knows why.
And the owl is prudently saying nothing.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL10.jpeg">
<I>OWL10 </I> - <B>Temperance Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>This Temperance owl is guarding an empty glass -- misguidedly. One might
almost say, intemperately.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL11.jpeg">
<I>OWL11 </I> - <B>Bon-vivant Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Bon-vivant owl has had a few too many.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL3.jpeg">
<I>OWL3 </I> - <B>Long-eared Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Long-eared owl has a knack for overhearing gossip.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL4.jpeg">
<I>OWL4 </I> - <B>Great Grey Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Great Grey owl is indeed, both great and gray ...
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL2.jpeg">
<I>OWL2 </I> - <B>Great Grey Owl, surprised</B><xxx>

<BR>but surprised that you should take the time to comment on something so obvious.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL5.jpeg">
<I>OWL5 </I> - <B>Owl of Athena</B><xxx>

<BR>The Owl of Athena is worried that you may find out the secret
of its wisdom ...
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL5R.jpeg">
<I>OWL5R </I> - <B>Owl of Athena, reversed</B><xxx>

<BR>which is, that it has eyes, like the god Janus, on both sides of
its head.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL7.jpeg">
<I>OWL7 </I> - <B>Predatory Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Predatory owl thinks that a mouse dinner would be a real hoot.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL8.jpeg">
<I>OWL8 </I> - <B>Inebriated Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Inebriated owl is a close relative of the Bon-vivant owl,
but has given up all hope of respectability.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/misc/OWL9.jpeg">
<I>OWL9 </I> - <B>Bump-on-a-log Owl</B><xxx>

<BR>The Bump-on-a-log owl gets a reputation for wisdom by merely looking
confused and saying very little -- wisely.
<P><B>End of the Owl Show.</B>
<BR>More owl show ideas: 
<BR>  The owl of Minerva takes flight at dusk.  Hegel?
<BR>  Macrame owl - hanging by a thread,  tied in knots?
<BR>  Canadian Tire owl
<BR>  Snowy owl
<BR>  Old mister owl - Disney
<BR>  Owl-eyed Athena - Merle in sunglasses.
<BR>
<BR>These should probably be bw images, drawings, etc. rather than colour.

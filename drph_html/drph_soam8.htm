<I>D226-497 09-06-21</I> - <B>No cars.</B><xxx>

<BR>As you can see, pedestrian friendly. The streets are narrow with a drainage
channel down the middle, shops on both sides. It's a paradise for the
rambler.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-498.jpeg">
<I>D226-498 09-06-21</I> - <B>To the thermal baths.</B><xxx>

<I>D226-499 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>We arrive at the baths and find the water tepid but relaxing. Not as hot as
we would have liked, coming off four days of strenuous marching along the
Inca Trail.
<BR>

<I>D226-502 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The atmosphere is communal. Everybody is having a good time. We park our
gear under that thatched roof by the wall. You can see Tim and Ian in the
bottom pool on the right. The pools have a gravel bottom, so the water is a
little silty. But without wanting to diminish Peruvian hospitality, I have to
admit that the water was much hotter in Ecuador at Papallacta. Q.V.

<BR>Following our dip we head back down the creek to the hotel.

<BR>Life goes on. That looks like Fred the cat trying to steal the black puppy's
dinner. A moment later the larger dog sets up a terrific barking to chase the
cat away. Some stores seem to do business renting towels for the baths,
although you can rent towels at the baths also.

<I>D226-511 09-06-21</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>A rock wall jumps up at the end of the street. This is probably
the same mountain we could see from the Sun Gate when we first viewed Machu
Picchu from above.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-512.jpeg">

<BR>The only street for motor vehicles near the centre of town.
Presumeably any vehicles used here have to be brought in by
railroad. I don't think there's any highway to drive them in
from Cuzco.
<BR>
<BR>Tomorrow we head back to Cuzco. There we'll watch the Inti Raymi, the
Festival of the Sun, on June 24th. We hope to see you there. Bye for now.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-515.jpeg">
<I>D226-515 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>At the entrance again for a second day. Our travel company, Metropolitan
Tours, has provided us with an extra day's tickets in case we weren't able to
pack everything in yesterday. That garish plant on the right looks almost
like a hypertrophied horse chestnut. I see that the two young ladies who
were poised on the brink yesterday have either taken wing or gone home.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-518.jpeg">
<I>D226-518 09-06-22</I> - <B>A more leisurely stroll today.</B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-519.jpeg">
<I>D226-519 09-06-22</I> - <B>A broad terrace at the site's base.</B><xxx>

<BR>Perfect place for a walk, away from the crowds. We arrive early. The sun is
up. The mists have dispersed. Let's wander around today with the idea of
savouring the general ambiance of the place.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-521.jpeg">
<I>D226-521 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Today we'll walk along the edge of the site. Through those broken walls on
the left. Along the terraces on the right. Then upward, where we'll proceed
toward the main altar, just visible on the left horizon.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-523.jpeg">
<I>D226-523 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>...
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-524.jpeg">
<I>D226-524 09-06-22</I> - <B>Guardhouse from lower level.</B><xxx>

<BR>I'm thinking that if we were to go directly from here up to the guardhouse,
it would be a long, steep climb up many terraces.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-525.jpeg">
<I>D226-525 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>First we'll thread our way through the maze of ruined walls in the middle.
Looks like the madding crowds are beginning to gather.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-527.jpeg">
<I>D226-527 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Better resist the temptation to make a side trip up there. Its easier to
walk on the level terrace than to go up those stairs at mile-high altitudes.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-529.jpeg">
<I>D226-529 09-06-22</I> - <B>Back toward Mt. Machu Picchu.</B><xxx>

<BR>You can see the path leading down from Inti Punku, the Sun Gate.
That's Mt. Machu Picchu in the background.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-530.jpeg">
<I>D226-530 09-06-22</I> - <B>A whole new slant on the stone age.</B><xxx>

<BR>See those 5 small stones embedded in the rock wall? Steps to
permit Inca workers to get from one terrace level to the next.
We've already used similar steps in other parts of the site.
This detail brings home our common mentality. I've just made a
resolution to never again bad-mouth the "stone age". As if this
was a period full of flintstone-like, knuckle-dragging
primitives. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-531.jpeg">
<I>D226-531 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Eventually, we hope to end up at the guardhouse on the top right.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-535.jpeg">
<I>D226-535 09-06-22</I> - <B>The Urubamba R.</B><xxx>

<BR>Notice the pattern of steps on the right ridge. Looks almost as
if it was created deliberately. Probably an accidental pattern.
But it does seems to have echoes in Inca iconography like the
scalloped edges in some of the agricultural terraces we saw a
few days ago.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-536.jpeg">
<I>D226-536 09-06-22</I> - <B>Meanwhile, back on the Orient Express.</B><xxx>

<BR>Way back there in a telephoto view we see a train of the Machu Picchu RR,
owned by the Orient Express. We heard our guides complain about this company
for reducing service for the locals and treating the line as a cash cow for
the tourist trade.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-539.jpeg">
<I>D226-539 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>These walls look almost too fresh and new to have survived from the 16th
century. If they <I>have</I> been restored, the stones have certainly been placed
with loving care. It looks almost like a contemporary building project in
progress, only waiting for the roofs and interiors to be finished.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-540.jpeg">
<I>D226-540 09-06-22</I> - <B>Do I see an echo?</B><xxx>

<BR>Several stones like this on the site, reflecting nearby mountain profiles.
The Incas not only coped with their environment, they seemed to worship the
mountains. Something in common with a few people today, I'll hazard.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-542.jpeg">
<I>D226-542 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Another example of a large stone mini-mountain embedded in other construction.
They seemed to have a genius for making an organic whole out of their own
construction and the rocky features of the site.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-543.jpeg">
<I>D226-543 09-06-22</I> - <B>Serious stone-work</B><xxx>

<BR>A fine example of Inca masonry. Hard to fit a knife blade
between many of these stones. How did the Incas do this? I don't
think I've heard a definitive answer. Probably not just a genius
for predicting how a stone would fit, then somehow carving it
ahead of time, and having it miraculously <I>TURN OUT</I> to fit. I
suspect they had a practical trial-and-error method.
<BR> For instance: trying the fit, with, say, a layer of leaves in
between, removing the stone, seeing the discrepancy printed in
green on the rock surfaces, taking material off to improve the
fit, repeating this to get as close as desired. My dentist uses
this technique with some sort of "dental carbon paper" which I
have to bite on. In addition, the stones could be roughly dished
where they meet. If one face was dished more than its
corresonding face, then the stones would meet only along a
narrower outer edge. This could then be speedily trimmed from
the outside without completely and repeatedly removing the stone
from its position.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-544.jpeg">
<I>D226-544 09-06-22</I> - <B>We ascend the high altar.</B><xxx>

<BR>The crowd has thinned out overnight, but still a line-up. This is probably
one of the most popular destinations on the site, next to the guard house.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-548.jpeg">
<I>D226-548 09-06-22</I> - <B>A gnomon and calendar stone.</B><xxx>

<BR>The focal point of the high altar. The planes of the stone appear to be oriented
either with points of the Inca compass, dates in their calendar, or with other
locations within view on the horizon.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-549.jpeg">
<I>D226-549 09-06-22</I> - <B>Feel the power?</B><xxx>

<BR>Hard to get near the stone, particularly with that tape round the edge to
keep us from putting paws on it. An enterprising guide is trying to suggest
to this young group that it may radiate a mysterious force. He has everybody
close their eyes and hold out palms to feel for the emanations emitted by
this rock of power.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-549A.jpeg">
<I>D226-549A V10-07-12</I> - <B>Feel the power? FX</B><xxx>

<BR>The visitors' faces have been allowed to show through the
outline effect. The picture is also brighter, contrastier and
sharper than the original. But it dispenses with a small amount
of (hopefully irrelevant) detail. Generally, the outline effect
lends itself more easily to subjects or artifacts that have
close to regular shapes, such as, architecture, masonry,
horizons, clothing. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-552.jpeg">
<I>D226-552 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>I don't feel any emanations, but certainly do feel the
significance of the thing. It's a focal point of such a vast
system of terraces and buildings, of a trail traversed for
hundreds of years by runners, porters and pilgrims up to the
present day. It would be hard NOT to be focussed on this
singular object, even if you don't know its exact cultural
significance
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-553.jpeg">
<I>D226-553 09-06-22</I> - <B>Slightly tapered window treatments.</B><xxx>

<BR>On the high altar platform, Merle is standing in front of a typical Inca
window. We're not quite sure if this taper was a purely aesthetic preference
or a structural issue. The lintel stone could be smaller than with a purely
rectangular window, and the form would approach a little closer to the ideal
of an arch.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-556.jpeg">
<I>D226-556 09-06-22</I> - <B>House walls repeat mountain profile.</B><xxx>

<BR>Do these house walls look like the mountain profiles behind them? The Inca
house-building technique was probably governed by the contruction materials
at hand. Yet there's a certain consistency that could have reinforced the
self-image of the inhabitants as a mountain people.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-557.jpeg">
<I>D226-557 09-06-22</I> - <B>Ascent to the Guardhouse.</B><xxx>

<BR>We decide to head for the final point in our morning tour. We look for
entrances, corridors, portals that lead in that direction.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-559.jpeg">
<I>D226-559 09-06-22</I> - <B>Portal.</B><xxx>

<BR>A lucky shot. The crowds have momentarily dispersed. I hear giggling and the
trampling of childish feet. The camera is booted up and ready and I snap the
picture just as she comes hurtling down the steps. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-559A.jpeg">
<I>D226-559A V10-07-12</I> - <B>Generation gap. FX</B><xxx>

<BR>The use of outlining here is obvious. The identity of the
blocks, their huge weight calls out for enhanced definition, to
support the picture's thematic possibilities. But the original
image of the girl, cute and vulnerable, has been allowed to show
through, and is less hard-edged than the surrounding portal.
Rarely, do I get such a powerful, on-the-spot intuition of a
pic's potential.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-562.jpeg">
<I>D226-562 09-06-22</I> - <B>Lintel.</B><xxx>

<BR>Another example of the loop-like protrusion (above the lintel)
that we've seen associated with other portals or windows. It
might have held a rope supporting some sort of door or curtain.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-564.jpeg">
<I>D226-564 09-06-22</I> - <B>Stairs up to the guard house.</B><xxx>

<BR>We locate the stairs going up. Similar to the stairs carved out of the
living rock that we saw back on the trail a few days back
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-565.jpeg">
<I>D226-565 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Getting closer, Puff, puff.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-566.jpeg">
<I>D226-566 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Under the eaves you can see the poles that are attached to those projections
in the stonework. The horizontal roof members are in turn attached to these
diagonal poles. An ingenious design to prevent the winds that must sometimes
prevail up here from taking off the roofs.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-567.jpeg">
<I>D226-567 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>A high vantage point beside the guard house. That's Huayna Picchu on the
right with terraces on the top. Apparently a daily quota of people are
allowed to climb up there. Just give me another week to get acclimatised and
I'll be ready. Oh! We're heading back to Cuzco tonight. Too bad.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-570.jpeg">
<I>D226-570 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The guard house is used today more as a shelter from the rain or as a small
lecture hall than a jail for uppity tourists. Nothing inside suggest what its
original function might have been.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-571.jpeg">
<I>D226-571 09-06-22</I> - <B>We choose a high terrace for a rest.</B><xxx>

<BR>We select a high terrace and walk backwards looking for a place to rest.
Oops, better not walk backwards with that drop-off on the left. But we will
find a good spot to contemplate the scene.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-572.jpeg">
<I>D226-572 09-06-22</I> - <B>Ah ...</B><xxx>

<BR>A perfect view. Time to sit down and put it all together. Say, I can see a huge
line-up on one of the inner walls of the courtyard. Looks like a major tourist
group has arrived. To the left centre you can see a quarry area with tumbled
pieces of large stone. This served the site as a sources of building
material.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-572A.jpeg">
<I>D226-572A V10-07-12</I> - <B>A room with a view. FX</B><xxx>

<BR>The effect here is subtle. You might not even guess that the original photo
has been adjusted. The local contrast has increased and the structure of the
image is, to me, clearer because of the small enhancement of the outlining.
plus the slight watercolour-ish blending and brightening of the colour areas
within the outlines.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-574.jpeg">
<I>D226-574 09-06-22</I> - <B>Japanese tourists, spiffy guide.</B><xxx>

<BR>Some of the most interesting tourists were the Japanese and certainly the
best-dressed. Their guide was quite fetching with her broad-brimmed hat and
immaculate white gloves. I could picture the wearer of that garden-party hat
presiding at a genteel tea-pouring with watercress sandwiches on the side.
But maybe I'm barking up the wrong culture.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-577.jpeg">
<I>D226-577 09-06-22</I> - <B>Aaah! Feel those vibes.</B><xxx>

<BR>Feels good to lie down and stretch out. As soon as we sit down, another 
person nearby lies down on the grass and begins to do those wierd
bum-in-the-clouds stretching excercises affected by people with back
problems. My heart goes out to her. By the by, I think I can now feel those
mysterious vibes from the high altar in the soles of my feet.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-579.jpeg">
<I>D226-579 09-06-22</I> - <B>The butt-end of Machu Picchu.</B><xxx>

<BR>On the back side of the site, note the curious step-like ridges. This seems
to echo something in Inca iconography. Or am I using that word "iconography"
too often? Check out the next picture from earlier today.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-535.jpeg">
<I>D226-535 09-06-22</I> - <B>Compare "steps" on the right.</B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D227/D227-191.jpeg">
<I>D227-191 09-06-23</I> - <B>Traces. A step-like design</B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-580.jpeg">
<I>D226-580 09-06-22</I> - <B>Lunch, empanadas, just off the site.</B><xxx>

<BR>We head for lunch and find that the snackbar, if you avoid the usual pizzas,
etc. catering to the gringo tourist, has delicious empanadas for a modest
price. This wandering dog crouches under out table hoping for crumbs. We
then take the bus back to town, down a series of hair-raising turns and
arrive safely to wander the streets waiting for our train's departure time.

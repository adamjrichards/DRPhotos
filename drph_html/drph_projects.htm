<P><B>Major Slide shows, Vacation Trips, Creative Projects</B>
<P> Some of these shows have synchronised sound commentary in WWWB
(WordWorkersWorkBench) and MP4 recorded movie versions.
<P> Shows in HTML format  can be viewed as
magazine-type articles. They've been tested on Android and
Windows hand-held devices. The present versions display best in
vertical or portrait orientations. Using the Chrome browser, the
images can be finger-zoomed to inspect detail and then returned
to standard width by double-tapping.
<P> Some browsers may not be able to cope with the lengthier pages. FireFox
seems to choke on a page with more than 30 or 40 images. Chrome
provides a "reload" option in case of browser difficulties.

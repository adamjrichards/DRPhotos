    These pelicans can't seem to pick up fish in the shallow end
of the pool. They might at least try pushing it into deep water
so they could get their beaks under it. Instead, they thrash
around getting nowhere for half an hour. Inability to solve this
simple problem doesn't say much for the birds' intelligence.

    A path leads up from the river bank to the gate of Lower
Fort Garry. A visitor in the old days would have seen the place
from this angle first. Mind you don't leave your luggage behind
in the York boat.

    Parks Canada animators dress up to impersonate typical
citizens of the pioneer period. This could be Governor's lady
leaving her residence for a stroll into the nearby settlement.
The fort was completed in 1837.

    Merle is pulling a Red River cart. It's every bit as rickety
as the descriptions you may have read. No iron is used in the
contruction and no grease on the axles. You could hear them
squeaking and groaning from miles away.

    The Governor's House in the middle of the compound is an
island of refinement. Pleasant lawns and gardens lure the
present-day visitor. Excuse us for suspecting that things
weren't so gracious-looking in the days of the fur trade.

    This storehouse inside the fort would have held bales of
furs and tradegoods of the period. Parks Canada has supplied
realistic imitations of pioneer tools and implements. The lofts
smell of hemp, tar and grain, the way country hardware stores
used to.

    Merle peers through the fortifications. Someone commented that
these loopholes in the walls of Lower Fort Garry might be more
dangerous to those inside than to an attacker on the outside.
Because of the taper you'd get better visibility looking in.

well stocked, and right on the highway west from Winnipeg. The

    Parks Canada tries hard to keep tourists interested in our
own national heritage. This animator is dressed in voyageur
costume. She explains that Jasper was once the depot for
all trans-mountain freight. It was brought here in canoes and
flat-bottom boats from the east, or by pack-train from the west.

    Mt Robson leaps 12,969' skyward behind Robson Meadows
campground. Someone told us of a guide who'd journeyed past here
30 times in his career and had only seen the top of the mountain
once. It's the highest point in the Canadian Rockies.

    The trail passes through an area of rain-forest growing
thickly with these large, thorny berry plants. They're closest
in appearance to the Thimbleberry. Near here, we're nearly
trampled by a moose. It suddenly breaks out of cover and gallops
across the trail right behind us.

    At end of our hike we stand on the shore of Kinney Lake
wishing we'd brought our backpacks. Berg lake is only a few
miles further on. Wilderness camping is permitted. The lake gets
its name from the small ice-bergs that sometimes break off the
snout of a nearby glacier.

    Merle symbolically rinses her handkerchief in the Fraser
River. Will the salt of a mother's tears reach Adam in Vancouver
before she herself does? For God's sake, Adam, write a little
more often.

<I>0315-36 88-08-14</I> - <B>Kamloops.</B>

    Kamloops lies at the junction of the Thompson and N.
Thompson Rivers. The surrounding hills are covered with dry
grassland and patches of forest. Seems more like the <U>American</U>
west than eastern Canadians usually expect.

<I>0315-24 88-08-13</I> - <B>Paul Lake Provincial Park near Kamloops.</B>

    Paul Lake Provincial Park is a favourite picnic and
swimming area for local residents. Up in the hills, the snow
collects more heavily and lasts longer. The extra moisture
promotes forest growth. You wouldn't know you're in the middle
of a semi-desert area a few miles away.

<I>0315-29 88-08-14</I> - <B>Kamloops area.</B>

    Like this, for instance. The sage-brushy, arid quality of
the countryside is apparent. Despite our committment to
chlorophyll, we have to admit being attracted by the wide-open
spaces. In earlier days, you might have ridden your horse as far
as the eye could see. In northern Ontario, that would be about 30 ft.

    When the sagebrush reaches this point, the value of the land
for pasture goes way down. Overgrazing encourages sagebrush by
killing off the bunch grass that normally grows here.

    A patch of motor trouble on the route west from Kamloops. The

    !Looking west, with the C.P.R. tracks down below. This is just

a bit dissatisfied with Derek's "boulder-through-the-window"
handling of the affair. A small boat skims up the lake.

    On a narrow, winding road we pull over to watch a succession
of inflatable rafts bring thrill-seekers down the river. Each is
powered by large outboard engines. The boats undulate like water
snakes as they navigate the waves and adapt to changing water
conditions.

    Merle overlooks the Fraser River near Hell's Gate. The
road itself must be almost as exciting as any raft trip. The
traffic is high-speed and impatient, and at times, that
guard-rail looks none too substantial.

    The address he'd given us didn't look too promising at first.
Months of junk mail had accumulated, making the building look
disused. Merle does a meditation on the bust of Wandering
Odysseus. Eventually we go round the back to look for another

    Compare these to the smaller, more hand-sized pieces of the
Plains and Woodland Indians, and the Inuit. The monumental
carvings of the west coast are in a special category. They seem
more on a par with the African and Oceanic art that started to
inspire our own artists round the end of the last century.

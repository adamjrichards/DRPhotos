<p class="line-break"></p>

<p>I sing of arms and the man, he who, exiled by fate,</p>
<p>first came from the coast of Troy to Italy, and to</p>
<p>Lavinian shores – hurled about endlessly by land and sea,</p>
<p>by the will of the gods, by cruel Juno’s remorseless anger,</p>
<p>long suffering also in war, until he founded a city</p>
<p>and brought his gods to Latium: from that the Latin people</p>
<p>came, the lords of Alba Longa, the walls of noble Rome.</p>
<p>Muse, tell me the cause: how was she offended in her divinity,</p>
<p>how was she grieved, the Queen of Heaven, to drive a man,</p>
<p>noted for virtue, to endure such dangers, to face so many</p>
<p>trials? Can there be such anger in the minds of the gods?</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054290">BkI:12-49 The Anger of Juno</span></h3>
<p>There was an ancient city, Carthage (held by colonists from Tyre),</p>
<p>opposite Italy, and the far-off mouths of the Tiber,</p>
<p>rich in wealth, and very savage in pursuit of war.</p>
<p>They say Juno loved this one land above all others,</p>
<p>even neglecting Samos: here were her weapons</p>
<p>and her chariot, even then the goddess worked at,</p>
<p>and cherished, the idea that it should have supremacy</p>
<p>over the nations, if only the fates allowed.</p>
<p>Yet she’d heard of offspring, derived from Trojan blood,</p>
<p>that would one day overthrow the Tyrian stronghold:</p>
<p>that from them a people would come, wide-ruling,</p>
<p>and proud in war, to Libya’s ruin: so the Fates ordained.</p>
<p>Fearing this, and remembering the ancient war</p>
<p>she had fought before, at Troy, for her dear Argos,</p>
<p>(and the cause of her anger and bitter sorrows</p>
<p>had not yet passed from her mind: the distant judgement</p>
<p>of Paris stayed deep in her heart, the injury to her scorned beauty,</p>
<p>her hatred of the race, and abducted Ganymede’s honours)</p>
<p>the daughter of Saturn, incited further by this,</p>
<p>hurled the Trojans, the Greeks and pitiless Achilles had left,</p>
<p>round the whole ocean, keeping them far from Latium:</p>
<p>they wandered for many years, driven by fate over all the seas.</p>
<p>Such an effort it was to found the Roman people.</p>
<p>They were hardly out of sight of Sicily’s isle, in deeper water,</p>
<p>joyfully spreading sail, bronze keel ploughing the brine,</p>
<p>when Juno, nursing the eternal wound in her breast,</p>
<p>spoke to herself: ‘Am I to abandon my purpose, conquered,</p>
<p>unable to turn the Teucrian king away from Italy!</p>
<p>Why, the fates forbid it. Wasn’t Pallas able to burn</p>
<p>the Argive fleet, to sink it in the sea, because of the guilt</p>
<p>and madness of one single man, Ajax, son of Oileus?</p>
<p>She herself hurled Jupiter’s swift fire from the clouds,</p>
<p>scattered the ships, and made the sea boil with storms:</p>
<p>She caught him up in a water-spout, as he breathed flame</p>
<p>from his pierced chest, and pinned him to a sharp rock:</p>
<p>yet I, who walk about as queen of the gods, wife</p>
<p>and sister of Jove, wage war on a whole race, for so many years.</p>
<p>Indeed, will anyone worship Juno’s power from now on,</p>
<p>or place offerings, humbly, on her altars?’</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054291">BkI:50-80 Juno Asks Aeolus for Help</span></h3>
<p>So debating with herself, her heart inflamed, the goddess</p>
<p>came to Aeolia, to the country of storms, the place</p>
<p>of wild gales. Here in his vast cave, King Aeolus,</p>
<p>keeps the writhing winds, and the roaring tempests,</p>
<p>under control, curbs them with chains and imprisonment.</p>
<p>They moan angrily at the doors, with a mountain’s vast murmurs:</p>
<p>Aeolus sits, holding his sceptre, in his high stronghold,</p>
<p>softening their passions, tempering their rage: if not,</p>
<p>they’d surely carry off seas and lands and the highest heavens,</p>
<p>with them, in rapid flight, and sweep them through the air.</p>
<p>But the all-powerful Father, fearing this, hid them</p>
<p>in dark caves, and piled a high mountain mass over them</p>
<p>and gave them a king, who by fixed agreement, would know</p>
<p>how to give the order to tighten or slacken the reins.</p>
<p>Juno now offered these words to him, humbly:</p>
<p>‘Aeolus, since the Father of gods, and king of men,</p>
<p>gave you the power to quell, and raise, the waves with the winds,</p>
<p>there is a people I hate sailing the Tyrrhenian Sea,</p>
<p>bringing Troy’s conquered gods to Italy:</p>
<p>Add power to the winds, and sink their wrecked boats,</p>
<p>or drive them apart, and scatter their bodies over the sea.</p>
<p>I have fourteen Nymphs of outstanding beauty:</p>
<p>of whom I’ll name Deiopea, the loveliest in looks,</p>
<p>joined in eternal marriage, and yours for ever, so that,</p>
<p>for such service to me as yours, she’ll spend all her years</p>
<p>with you, and make you the father of lovely children.’</p>
<p>Aeolus replied: ‘Your task, O queen, is to decide</p>
<p>what you wish: my duty is to fulfil your orders.</p>
<p>You brought about all this kingdom of mine, the sceptre,</p>
<p>Jove’s favour, you gave me a seat at the feasts of the gods,</p>
<p>and you made me lord of the storms and the tempests.’</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054292">BkI:81-123 Aeolus Raises the Storm</span></h3>
<p>When he had spoken, he reversed his trident and struck</p>
<p>the hollow mountain on the side: and the winds, formed ranks,</p>
<p>rushed out by the door he’d made, and whirled across the earth.</p>
<p>They settle on the sea, East and West wind,</p>
<p>and the wind from Africa, together, thick with storms,</p>
<p>stir it all from its furthest deeps, and roll vast waves to shore:</p>
<p>follows a cry of men and a creaking of cables.</p>
<p>Suddenly clouds take sky and day away</p>
<p>from the Trojan’s eyes: dark night rests on the sea.</p>
<p>It thunders from the pole, and the aether flashes thick fire,</p>
<p>and all things threaten immediate death to men.</p>
<p>Instantly Aeneas groans, his limbs slack with cold:</p>
<p>stretching his two hands towards the heavens,</p>
<p>he cries out in this voice: ‘Oh, three, four times fortunate</p>
<p>were those who chanced to die in front of their father’s eyes</p>
<p>under Troy’s high walls! O Diomede, son of Tydeus</p>
<p>bravest of Greeks! Why could I not have fallen, at your hand,</p>
<p>in the fields of Ilium, and poured out my spirit,</p>
<p>where fierce Hector lies, beneath Achilles’s spear,</p>
<p>and mighty Sarpedon: where Simois rolls, and sweeps away</p>
<p>so many shields, helmets, brave bodies, of men, in its waves!’</p>
<p>Hurling these words out, a howling blast from the north,</p>
<p>strikes square on the sail, and lifts the seas to heaven:</p>
<p>the oars break: then the prow swings round and offers</p>
<p>the beam to the waves: a steep mountain of water follows in a mass.</p>
<p>Some ships hang on the breaker’s crest: to others the yawning deep</p>
<p>shows land between the waves: the surge rages with sand.</p>
<p>The south wind catches three, and whirls them onto hidden rocks</p>
<p>(rocks the Italians call the Altars, in mid-ocean,</p>
<p>a vast reef on the surface of the sea) three the east wind drives</p>
<p>from the deep, to the shallows and quick-sands (a pitiful sight),</p>
<p>dashes them against the bottom, covers them with a gravel mound.</p>
<p>A huge wave, toppling, strikes one astern, in front of his very eyes,</p>
<p>one carrying faithful Orontes and the Lycians.</p>
<p>The steersman’s thrown out and hurled headlong, face down:</p>
<p>but the sea turns the ship three times, driving her round,</p>
<p>in place, and the swift vortex swallows her in the deep.</p>
<p>Swimmers appear here and there in the vast waste,</p>
<p>men’s weapons, planking, Trojan treasure in the waves.</p>
<p>Now the storm conquers Iloneus’s tough ship, now Achates,</p>
<p>now that in which Abas sailed, and old Aletes’s:</p>
<p>their timbers sprung in their sides, all the ships</p>
<p>let in the hostile tide, and split open at the seams.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054293">BkI:124-156 Neptune Intervenes</span></h3>
<p>Neptune, meanwhile, greatly troubled, saw that the sea</p>
<p>was churned with vast murmur, and the storm was loose</p>
<p>and the still waters welled from their deepest levels:</p>
<p>he raised his calm face from the waves, gazing over the deep.</p>
<p>He sees Aeneas’s fleet scattered all over the ocean,</p>
<p>the Trojans crushed by the breakers, and the plummeting sky.</p>
<p>And Juno’s anger, and her stratagems, do not escape her brother.</p>
<p>He calls the East and West winds to him, and then says:</p>
<p>‘Does confidence in your birth fill you so? Winds, do you dare,</p>
<p>without my intent, to mix earth with sky, and cause such trouble,</p>
<p>now? You whom I – ! But it’s better to calm the running waves:</p>
<p>you’ll answer to me later for this misfortune, with a different punishment.</p>
<p>Hurry, fly now, and say this to your king:</p>
<p>control of the ocean, and the fierce trident, were given to me,</p>
<p>by lot, and not to him. He owns the wild rocks, home to you,</p>
<p>and yours, East Wind: let Aeolus officiate in his palace,</p>
<p>and be king in the closed prison of the winds.’</p>
<p>So he speaks, and swifter than his speech, he calms the swollen sea,</p>
<p>scatters the gathered cloud, and brings back the sun.</p>
<p>Cymothoë and Triton, working together, thrust the ships</p>
<p>from the sharp reef: Neptune himself raises them with his trident,</p>
<p>parts the vast quicksand, tempers the flood,</p>
<p>and glides on weightless wheels, over the tops of the waves.</p>
<p>As often, when rebellion breaks out in a great nation,</p>
<p>and the common rabble rage with passion, and soon stones</p>
<p>and fiery torches fly (frenzy supplying weapons),</p>
<p>if they then see a man of great virtue, and weighty service,</p>
<p>they are silent, and stand there listening attentively:</p>
<p>he sways their passions with his words and soothes their hearts:</p>
<p>so all the uproar of the ocean died, as soon as their father,</p>
<p>gazing over the water, carried through the clear sky, wheeled</p>
<p>his horses, and gave them their head, flying behind in his chariot.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054294">BkI:157-222 Shelter on the Libyan Coast</span></h3>
<p>The weary followers of Aeneas made efforts to set a course</p>
<p>for the nearest land, and tacked towards the Libyan coast.</p>
<p>There is a place there in a deep inlet: an island forms a harbour</p>
<p>with the barrier of its bulk, on which every wave from the deep</p>
<p>breaks, and divides into diminishing ripples.</p>
<p>On this side and that, vast cliffs and twin crags loom in the sky,</p>
<p>under whose summits the whole sea is calm, far and wide:</p>
<p>then, above that, is a scene of glittering woods,</p>
<p>and a dark grove overhangs the water, with leafy shade:</p>
<p>under the headland opposite is a cave, curtained with rock,</p>
<p>inside it, fresh water, and seats of natural stone,</p>
<p>the home of Nymphs. No hawsers moor the weary ships</p>
<p>here, no anchor, with its hooked flukes, fastens them.</p>
<p>Aeneas takes shelter here with seven ships gathered</p>
<p>from the fleet, and the Trojans, with a passion for dry land,</p>
<p>disembarking, take possession of the sands they longed for,</p>
<p>and stretch their brine-caked bodies on the shore.</p>
<p>At once Achates strikes a spark from his flint,</p>
<p>catches the fire in the leaves, places dry fuel round it,</p>
<p>and quickly has flames among the kindling.</p>
<p>Then, wearied by events, they take out wheat, damaged</p>
<p>by the sea, and implements of Ceres, and prepare to parch</p>
<p>the grain over the flames, and grind it on stone.</p>
<p>Aeneas climbs a crag meanwhile, and searches the whole prospect</p>
<p>far and wide over the sea, looking if he can see anything</p>
<p>of Antheus and his storm-tossed Phrygian galleys,</p>
<p>or Capys, or Caicus’s arms blazoned on a high stern.</p>
<p>There’s no ship in sight: he sees three stags wandering</p>
<p>on the shore: whole herds of deer follow at their back,</p>
<p>and graze in long lines along the valley.</p>
<p>He halts at this, and grasps in his hand his bow</p>
<p>and swift arrows, shafts that loyal Achates carries,</p>
<p>and first he shoots the leaders themselves, their heads,</p>
<p>with branching antlers, held high, then the mass, with his shafts,</p>
<p>and drives the whole crowd in confusion among the leaves:</p>
<p>The conqueror does not stop until he’s scattered seven huge</p>
<p>carcasses on the ground, equal in number to his ships.</p>
<p>Then he seeks the harbour, and divides them among all his friends.</p>
<p>Next he shares out the wine that the good Acestes had stowed</p>
<p>in jars, on the Trinacrian coast, and that hero had given them</p>
<p>on leaving: and speaking to them, calmed their sad hearts:</p>
<p>‘O friends (well, we were not unknown to trouble before)</p>
<p>O you who’ve endured worse, the god will grant an end to this too.</p>
<p>You’ve faced rabid Scylla, and her deep-sounding cliffs:</p>
<p>and you’ve experienced the Cyclopes’s rocks:</p>
<p>remember your courage and chase away gloomy fears:</p>
<p>perhaps one day you’ll even delight in remembering this.</p>
<p>Through all these misfortunes, these dangerous times,</p>
<p>we head for Latium, where the fates hold peaceful lives</p>
<p>for us: there Troy’s kingdom can rise again. Endure,</p>
<p>and preserve yourselves for happier days.’</p>
<p>So his voice utters, and sick with the weight of care, he pretends</p>
<p>hope, in his look, and stifles the pain deep in his heart.</p>
<p>They make ready the game, and the future feast:</p>
<p>they flay the hides from the ribs and lay the flesh bare:</p>
<p>some cut it in pieces, quivering, and fix it on spits,</p>
<p>others place cauldrons on the beach, and feed them with flames.</p>
<p>Then they revive their strength with food, stretched on the grass,</p>
<p>and fill themselves with rich venison and old wine.</p>
<p>When hunger is quenched by the feast, and the remnants cleared,</p>
<p>deep in conversation, they discuss their missing friends,</p>
<p>and, between hope and fear, question whether they live,</p>
<p>or whether they’ve suffered death and no longer hear their name.</p>
<p>Aeneas, the virtuous, above all mourns the lot of fierce Orontes,</p>
<p>then that of Amycus, together with Lycus’s cruel fate,</p>
<p>and those of brave Gyus, and brave Cloanthus.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054295">BkI:223-256 Venus Intercedes with Jupiter</span></h3>
<p>Now, all was complete, when Jupiter, from the heights of the air,</p>
<p>looked down on the sea with its flying sails, and the broad lands,</p>
<p>and the coasts, and the people far and wide, and paused,</p>
<p>at the summit of heaven, and fixed his eyes on the Libyan kingdom.</p>
<p>And as he weighed such cares as he had in his heart, Venus spoke</p>
<p>to him, sadder still, her bright eyes brimming with tears:</p>
<p>‘Oh you who rule things human, and divine, with eternal law,</p>
<p>and who terrify them all with your lightning-bolt,</p>
<p>what can my Aeneas have done to you that’s so serious,</p>
<p>what have the Trojans done, who’ve suffered so much destruction,</p>
<p>to whom the whole world’s closed, because of the Italian lands?</p>
<p>Surely you promised that at some point, as the years rolled by,</p>
<p>the Romans would rise from them, leaders would rise,</p>
<p>restored from Teucer’s blood, who would hold power</p>
<p>over the sea, and all the lands. Father, what thought has changed</p>
<p>your mind? It consoled me for the fall of Troy, and its sad ruin,</p>
<p>weighing one destiny, indeed, against opposing destinies:</p>
<p>now the same misfortune follows these men driven on by such</p>
<p>disasters. Great king, what end to their efforts will you give?</p>
<p>Antenor could escape through the thick of the Greek army,</p>
<p>and safely enter the Illyrian gulfs, and deep into the realms</p>
<p>of the Liburnians, and pass the founts of Timavus,</p>
<p>from which the river bursts, with a huge mountainous roar,</p>
<p>through nine mouths, and buries the fields under its noisy flood.</p>
<p>Here, nonetheless, he sited the city of Padua, and homes</p>
<p>for Teucrians, and gave the people a name, and hung up</p>
<p>the arms of Troy: now he’s calmly settled, in tranquil peace.</p>
<p>But we, your race, to whom you permit the heights of heaven,</p>
<p>lose our ships (shameful!), betrayed, because of one person’s anger,</p>
<p>and kept far away from the shores of Italy.</p>
<p>Is this the prize for virtue? Is this how you restore our rule?</p>
<p>The father of men and gods, smiled at her with that look</p>
<p>with which he clears the sky of storms,</p>
<p>kissed his daughter’s lips, and then said this:</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<p>You’ll see the city of Lavinium, and the walls I promised,</p>
<p>and you’ll raise great-hearted Aeneas high, to the starry sky:</p>
<p>No thought has changed my mind. This son of yours</p>
<p>(since this trouble gnaws at my heart, I’ll speak,</p>
<p>and unroll the secret scroll of destiny)</p>
<p>will wage a mighty war in Italy, destroy proud peoples,</p>
<p>and establish laws, and city walls, for his warriors,</p>
<p>until a third summer sees his reign in Latium, and</p>
<p>three winter camps pass since the Rutulians were beaten.</p>
<p>But the boy Ascanius, surnamed Iulus now (He was Ilus</p>
<p>while the Ilian kingdom was a reality) will imperially</p>
<p>complete thirty great circles of the turning months,</p>
<p>and transfer his throne from its site at Lavinium,</p>
<p>and mighty in power, will build the walls of Alba Longa.</p>
<p>Here kings of Hector’s race will reign now</p>
<p>for three hundred years complete, until a royal priestess,</p>
<p>Ilia, heavy with child, shall bear Mars twins.</p>
<p>Then Romulus will further the race, proud in his nurse</p>
<p>the she-wolf’s tawny pelt, and found the walls of Mars,</p>
<p>and call the people Romans, from his own name.</p>
<p>I’ve fixed no limits or duration to their possessions:</p>
<p>I’ve given them empire without end. Why, harsh Juno</p>
<p>who now torments land, and sea and sky with fear,</p>
<p>will respond to better judgement, and favour the Romans,</p>
<p>masters of the world, and people of the toga, with me.</p>
<p>So it is decreed. A time will come, as the years glide by,</p>
<p>when the Trojan house of Assaracus will force Phthia</p>
<p>into slavery, and be lords of beaten Argos.</p>
<p>From this glorious source a Trojan Caesar will be born,</p>
<p>who will bound the empire with Ocean, his fame with the stars,</p>
<p>Augustus, a Julius, his name descended from the great Iulus.</p>
<p>You, no longer anxious, will receive him one day in heaven,</p>
<p>burdened with Eastern spoils: he’ll be called to in prayer.</p>
<p>Then with wars abandoned, the harsh ages will grow mild:</p>
<p>White haired Trust, and Vesta, Quirinus with his brother Remus</p>
<p>will make the laws: the gates of War, grim with iron,</p>
<p>and narrowed by bars, will be closed: inside impious Rage will roar</p>
<p>frighteningly from blood-stained mouth, seated on savage weapons,</p>
<p>hands tied behind his back, with a hundred knots of bronze.’</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054297">BkI:297-371 Venus Speaks to Aeneas</span></h3>
<p>Saying this, he sends Mercury, Maia’s son, down from heaven,</p>
<p>so that the country and strongholds of this new Carthage</p>
<p>would open to the Trojans, as guests, and Dido, unaware of fate,</p>
<p>would not keep them from her territory. He flies through the air</p>
<p>with a beating of mighty wings and quickly lands on Libyan shore.</p>
<p>And soon does as commanded, and the Phoenicians set aside</p>
<p>their savage instincts, by the god’s will: the queen above all</p>
<p>adopts calm feelings, and kind thoughts, towards the Trojans.</p>
<p>But Aeneas, the virtuous, turning things over all night,</p>
<p>decides, as soon as kindly dawn appears, to go out</p>
<p>and explore the place, to find what shores he has reached,</p>
<p>on the wind, who owns them (since he sees desert)</p>
<p>man or beast, and bring back the details to his friends.</p>
<p>He conceals the boats in over-hanging woods</p>
<p>under an arching cliff, enclosed by trees</p>
<p>and leafy shadows: accompanied only by Achetes,</p>
<p>he goes, swinging two broad-bladed spears in his hand.</p>
<p>His mother met him herself, among the trees, with the face</p>
<p>and appearance of a virgin, and a virgin’s weapons,</p>
<p>a Spartan girl, or such as Harpalyce of Thrace,</p>
<p>who wearies horses, and outdoes winged Hebrus in flight.</p>
<p>For she’d slung her bow from her shoulders, at the ready,</p>
<p>like a huntress, and loosed her hair for the wind to scatter,</p>
<p>her knees bare, and her flowing tunic gathered up in a knot.</p>
<p>And she cried first: ‘Hello, you young men, tell me,</p>
<p>if you’ve seen my sister wandering here by any chance,</p>
<p>wearing a quiver, and the hide of a dappled lynx,</p>
<p>or shouting, hot on the track of a slavering boar?’</p>
<p>So Venus: and so Venus’s son began in answer:</p>
<p>‘I’ve not seen or heard any of your sisters, O Virgin –</p>
<p>or how should I name you? Since your looks are not mortal</p>
<p>and your voice is more than human: oh, a goddess for certain!</p>
<p>Or Phoebus’s sister? Or one of the race of Nymphs?</p>
<p>Be kind, whoever you may be, and lighten our labour,</p>
<p>and tell us only what sky we’re under, and what shores</p>
<p>we’ve landed on: we’re adrift here, driven by wind and vast seas,</p>
<p>knowing nothing of the people or the country:</p>
<p>many a sacrifice to you will fall at the altars, under our hand.’</p>
<p>Then Venus said: ‘I don’t think myself worthy of such honours:</p>
<p>it’s the custom of Tyrian girls to carry a quiver,</p>
<p>and lace our calves high up, over red hunting boots.</p>
<p>You see the kingdom of Carthage, Tyrians, Agenor’s city:</p>
<p>but bordered by Libyans, a people formidable in war.</p>
<p>Dido rules this empire, having set out from Tyre,</p>
<p>fleeing her brother. It’s a long tale of wrong, with many</p>
<p>windings: but I’ll trace the main chapters of the story.</p>
<p>Sychaeus was her husband, wealthiest, in land, of Phoenicians</p>
<p>and loved with a great love by the wretched girl,</p>
<p>whose father gave her as a virgin to him, and wed them</p>
<p>with great solemnity. But her brother Pygmalion, savage</p>
<p>in wickedness beyond all others, held the kingdom of Tyre.</p>
<p>Madness came between them. The king, blinded by greed for gold,</p>
<p>killed the unwary Sychaeus, secretly, with a knife, impiously,</p>
<p>in front of the altars, indifferent to his sister’s affections.</p>
<p>He concealed his actions for a while, deceived the lovesick girl,</p>
<p>with empty hopes, and many evil pretences.</p>
<p>But the ghost of her unburied husband came to her in dream:</p>
<p>lifting his pale head in a strange manner, he laid bare the cruelty</p>
<p>at the altars, and his heart pierced by the knife,</p>
<p>and unveiled all the secret wickedness of that house.</p>
<p>Then he urged her to leave quickly and abandon her country,</p>
<p>and, to help her journey, revealed an ancient treasure</p>
<p>under the earth, an unknown weight of gold and silver.</p>
<p>Shaken by all this, Dido prepared her flight and her friends.</p>
<p>Those who had fierce hatred of the tyrant or bitter fear,</p>
<p>gathered together: they seized some ships that by chance</p>
<p>were ready, and loaded the gold: greedy Pygmalion’s riches</p>
<p>are carried overseas: a woman leads the enterprise.</p>
<p>The came to this place, and bought land, where you now see</p>
<p>the vast walls, and resurgent stronghold, of new Carthage,</p>
<p>as much as they could enclose with the strips of hide</p>
<p>from a single bull, and from that they called it Byrsa.</p>
<p>But who then are you? What shores do you come from?</p>
<p>What course do you take?’ He sighed as she questioned him,</p>
<p>and drawing the words from deep in his heart he replied:</p>

<p class="text-align-center fontsize12px">‘Aeneas Recognising Venus as She Disappears in a Cloud’ - Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (Italy, 1727–1804),  <em><a href="http://artgallery.yale.edu/" title="Yale University Art Gallery">Yale University Art Gallery</a></em></p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<p>‘O goddess, if I were to start my tale at the very beginning,</p>
<p>and you had time to hear the story of our misfortunes,</p>
<p>Vesper would have shut day away in the closed heavens.</p>
<p>A storm drove us at whim to Libya’s shores,</p>
<p>sailing the many seas from ancient Troy,</p>
<p>if by chance the name of Troy has come to your hearing.</p>
<p>I am that Aeneas, the virtuous, who carries my household gods</p>
<p>in my ship with me, having snatched them from the enemy,</p>
<p>my name is known beyond the sky.</p>
<p>I seek my country Italy, and a people born of Jupiter on high.</p>
<p>I embarked on the Phrygian sea with twenty ships,</p>
<p>following my given fate, my mother, a goddess, showing the way:</p>
<p>barely seven are left, wrenched from the wind and waves.</p>
<p>I myself wander, destitute and unknown, in the Libyan desert,</p>
<p>driven from Europe and Asia.’ Venus did not wait</p>
<p>for further complaint but broke in on his lament like this:</p>
<p>‘Whoever you are I don’t think you draw the breath of life</p>
<p>while hated by the gods, you who’ve reached a city of Tyre.</p>
<p>Only go on from here, and take yourself to the queen’s threshold,</p>
<p>since I bring you news that your friends are restored,</p>
<p>and your ships recalled, driven to safety by the shifting winds,</p>
<p>unless my parents taught me false prophecies, in vain.</p>
<p>See, those twelve swans in exultant line, that an eagle,</p>
<p>Jupiter’s bird, swooping from the heavens,</p>
<p>was troubling in the clear sky: now, in a long file, they seem</p>
<p>to have settled, or be gazing down now at those who already have.</p>
<p>As, returning, their wings beat in play, and they circle the zenith</p>
<p>in a crowd, and give their cry, so your ships and your people</p>
<p>are in harbour, or near its entrance under full sail.</p>
<p>Only go on, turn your steps where the path takes you.’</p>
<p>She spoke, and turning away she reflected the light</p>
<p>from her rose-tinted neck, and breathed a divine perfume</p>
<p>from her ambrosial hair: her robes trailed down to her feet,</p>
<p>and, in her step, showed her a true goddess. He recognised</p>
<p>his mother, and as she vanished followed her with his voice:</p>
<p>‘You too are cruel, why do you taunt your son with false</p>
<p>phantoms? Why am I not allowed to join hand</p>
<p>with hand, and speak and hear true words?’</p>
<p>So he accuses her, and turns his steps towards the city.</p>
<p>But Venus veiled them with a dark mist as they walked,</p>
<p>and, as a goddess, spread a thick covering of cloud around them,</p>
<p>so that no one could see them, or touch them,</p>
<p>or cause them delay, or ask them where they were going.</p>
<p>She herself soars high in the air, to Paphos, and returns to her home</p>
<p>with delight, where her temple and its hundred altars</p>
<p>steam with Sabean incense, fragrant with fresh garlands.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054299">BkI:418-463 The Temple of Juno</span></h3>
<p>Meanwhile they’ve tackled the route the path revealed.</p>
<p>And soon they climbed the hill that looms high over the city,</p>
<p>and looks down from above on the towers that face it.</p>
<p>Aeneas marvels at the mass of buildings, once huts,</p>
<p>marvels at the gates, the noise, the paved roads.</p>
<p>The eager Tyrians are busy, some building walls,</p>
<p>and raising the citadel, rolling up stones by hand,</p>
<p>some choosing the site for a house, and marking a furrow:</p>
<p>they make magistrates and laws, and a sacred senate:</p>
<p>here some are digging a harbour: others lay down</p>
<p>the deep foundations of a theatre, and carve huge columns</p>
<p>from the cliff, tall adornments for the future stage.</p>
<p>Just as bees in early summer carry out their tasks</p>
<p>among the flowery fields, in the sun, when they lead out</p>
<p>the adolescent young of their race, or cram the cells</p>
<p>with liquid honey, and swell them with sweet nectar,</p>
<p>or receive the incoming burdens, or forming lines</p>
<p>drive the lazy herd of drones from their hives:</p>
<p>the work glows, and the fragrant honey’s sweet with thyme.</p>
<p>‘O fortunate those whose walls already rise!’</p>
<p>Aeneas cries, and admires the summits of the city.</p>
<p>He enters among them, veiled in mist (marvellous to tell)</p>
<p>and mingles with the people seen by no one.</p>
<p>There was a grove in the centre of the city, delightful</p>
<p>with shade, where the wave and storm-tossed Phoenicians</p>
<p>first uncovered the head of a fierce horse, that regal Juno</p>
<p>showed them: so the race would be noted in war,</p>
<p>and rich in substance throughout the ages.</p>
<p>Here Sidonian Dido was establishing a great temple</p>
<p>to Juno, rich with gifts and divine presence,</p>
<p>with bronze entrances rising from stairways, and beams</p>
<p>jointed with bronze, and hinges creaking on bronze doors.</p>
<p>Here in the grove something new appeared that calmed his fears</p>
<p>for the first time, here for the first time Aeneas dared to hope</p>
<p>for safety, and to put greater trust in his afflicted fortunes.</p>
<p>While, waiting for the queen, in the vast temple, he looks</p>
<p>at each thing: while he marvels at the city’s wealth,</p>
<p>the skill of their artistry, and the products of their labours,</p>
<p>he sees the battles at Troy in their correct order,</p>
<p>the War, known through its fame to the whole world,</p>
<p>the sons of Atreus, of Priam, and Achilles angered with both.</p>
<p>He halted, and said, with tears: ‘What place is there,</p>
<p>Achates, what region of earth not full of our hardships?</p>
<p>See, Priam! Here too virtue has its rewards, here too</p>
<p>there are tears for events, and mortal things touch the heart.</p>
<p>Lose your fears: this fame will bring you benefit.’</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054300">BkI:464-493 The Frieze</span></h3>
<p>So he speaks, and feeds his spirit with the insubstantial frieze,</p>
<p>sighing often, and his face wet with the streaming tears.</p>
<p>For he saw how, here, the Greeks fled, as they fought round Troy,</p>
<p>chased by the Trojan youth, and, there, the Trojans fled,</p>
<p>with plumed Achilles pressing them close in his chariot.</p>
<p>Not far away, through his tears, he recognises Rhesus’s</p>
<p>white-canvassed tents, that blood-stained Diomede, Tydeus’s son,</p>
<p>laid waste with great slaughter, betrayed in their first sleep,</p>
<p>diverting the fiery horses to his camp, before they could eat</p>
<p>Trojan fodder, or drink from the river Xanthus.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Troilus, his weapons discarded in flight,</p>
<p>unhappy boy, unequally matched in his battle with Achilles,</p>
<p>is dragged by his horses, clinging face-up to the empty chariot,</p>
<p>still clutching the reins: his neck and hair trailing</p>
<p>on the ground, and his spear reversed furrowing the dust.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Trojan women with loose hair, walked</p>
<p>to unjust Pallas’s temple carrying the sacred robe,</p>
<p>mourning humbly, and beating their breasts with their hands.</p>
<p>The goddess was turned away, her eyes fixed on the ground.</p>
<p>Three times had Achilles dragged Hector round the walls of Troy,</p>
<p>and now was selling the lifeless corpse for gold.</p>
<p>Then Aeneas truly heaves a deep sigh, from the depths of his heart,</p>
<p>as he views the spoils, the chariot, the very body of his friend,</p>
<p>and Priam stretching out his unwarlike hands.</p>
<p>He recognised himself as well, fighting the Greek princes,</p>
<p>and the Ethiopian ranks and black Memnon’s armour.</p>
<p>Raging Penthesilea leads the file of Amazons,</p>
<p>with crescent shields, and shines out among her thousands,</p>
<p>her golden girdle fastened beneath her exposed breasts,</p>
<p>a virgin warrior daring to fight with men.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054301">BkI:494-519 The Arrival of Queen Dido</span></h3>
<p>While these wonderful sights are viewed by Trojan Aeneas,</p>
<p>while amazed he hangs there, rapt, with fixed gaze,</p>
<p>Queen Dido, of loveliest form, reached the temple,</p>
<p>with a great crowd of youths accompanying her.</p>
<p>Just as Diana leads her dancing throng on Eurotas’s banks,</p>
<p>or along the ridges of Cynthus, and, following her,</p>
<p>a thousand mountain-nymphs gather on either side:</p>
<p>and she carries a quiver on her shoulder, and overtops</p>
<p>all the other goddesses as she walks: and delight</p>
<p>seizes her mother Latona’s silent heart:</p>
<p>such was Dido, so she carried herself, joyfully,</p>
<p>amongst them, furthering the work, and her rising kingdom.</p>
<p>Then, fenced with weapons, and resting on a high throne,</p>
<p>she took her seat, at the goddess’s doorway, under the central vault.</p>
<p>She was giving out laws and statutes to the people, and sharing</p>
<p>the workers labour out in fair proportions, or assigning it by lot:</p>
<p>when Aeneas suddenly saw Antheus, and Sergestus,</p>
<p>and brave Cloanthus, approaching, among a large crowd,</p>
<p>with others of the Trojans whom the black storm-clouds</p>
<p>had scattered over the sea and carried far off to other shores.</p>
<p>He was stunned, and Achates was stunned as well</p>
<p>with joy and fear: they burned with eagerness to clasp hands,</p>
<p>but the unexpected event confused their minds.</p>
<p>They stay concealed and, veiled in the deep mist, they watch</p>
<p>to see what happens to their friends, what shore they have left</p>
<p>the fleet on, and why they are here: the elect of every ship came</p>
<p>begging favour, and made for the temple among the shouting.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054302">BkI:520-560 Ilioneus Asks Her Assistance</span></h3>
<p>When they’d entered, and freedom to speak in person</p>
<p>had been granted, Ilioneus, the eldest, began calmly:</p>
<p>‘O queen, whom Jupiter grants the right to found</p>
<p>a new city, and curb proud tribes with your justice,</p>
<p>we unlucky Trojans, driven by the winds over every sea,</p>
<p>pray to you: keep the terror of fire away from our ships,</p>
<p>spare a virtuous race and look more kindly on our fate.</p>
<p>We have not come to despoil Libyan homes with the sword,</p>
<p>or to carry off stolen plunder to the shore: that violence</p>
<p>is not in our minds, the conquered have not such pride.</p>
<p>There’s a place called Hesperia by the Greeks,</p>
<p>an ancient land, strong in men, with a rich soil:</p>
<p>There the Oenotrians lived: now rumour has it</p>
<p>that a later people has called it Italy, after their leader.</p>
<p>We had set our course there when stormy Orion,</p>
<p>rising with the tide, carried us onto hidden shoals,</p>
<p>and fierce winds scattered us far, with the overwhelming surge,</p>
<p>over the waves among uninhabitable rocks:</p>
<p>we few have drifted here to your shores.</p>
<p>What race of men is this? What land is so barbaric as to allow</p>
<p>this custom, that we’re denied the hospitality of the sands?</p>
<p>They stir up war, and prevent us setting foot on dry land.</p>
<p>If you despise the human race and mortal weapons,</p>
<p>still trust that the gods remember right and wrong.</p>
<p>Aeneas was our king, no one more just than him</p>
<p>in his duty, or greater in war and weaponry.</p>
<p>If fate still protects the man, if he still enjoys the ethereal air,</p>
<p>if he doesn’t yet rest among the cruel shades, there’s nothing</p>
<p>to fear, and you’d not repent of vying with him first in kindness.</p>
<p>Then there are cities and fields too in the region of Sicily,</p>
<p>and famous Acestes, of Trojan blood. Allow us</p>
<p>to beach our fleet, damaged by the storms,</p>
<p>and cut planks from trees, and shape oars,</p>
<p>so if our king’s restored and our friends are found</p>
<p>we can head for Italy, gladly seek Italy and Latium:</p>
<p>and if our saviour’s lost, and the Libyan seas hold you,</p>
<p>Troy’s most virtuous father, if no hope now remains from Iulus,</p>
<p>let us seek the Sicilian straits, from which we were driven,</p>
<p>and the home prepared for us, and a king, Acestes.’</p>
<p>So Ilioneus spoke: and the Trojans all shouted with one voice.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054303">BkI:561-585 Dido Welcomes the Trojans</span></h3>
<p>Then, Dido, spoke briefly, with lowered eyes:</p>
<p>‘Trojans, free your hearts of fear: dispel your cares.</p>
<p>Harsh events and the newness of the kingdom force me to effect</p>
<p>such things, and protect my borders with guards on all sides.</p>
<p>Who doesn’t know of Aeneas’s race, and the city of Troy,</p>
<p>the bravery, the men, or so great a blaze of warfare,</p>
<p>indeed, we Phoenicians don’t possess unfeeling hearts,</p>
<p>the sun doesn’t harness his horses that far from this Tyrian city.</p>
<p>Whether you opt for mighty Hesperia, and Saturn’s fields,</p>
<p>or the summit of Eryx, and Acestes for king,</p>
<p>I’ll see you safely escorted, and help you with my wealth.</p>
<p>Or do you wish to settle here with me, as equals in my kingdom?</p>
<p>The city I build is yours: beach your ships:</p>
<p>Trojans and Tyrians will be treated by me without distinction.</p>
<p>I wish your king Aeneas himself were here, driven</p>
<p>by that same storm! Indeed, I’ll send reliable men</p>
<p>along the coast, and order them to travel the length of Libya,</p>
<p>in case he’s driven aground, and wandering the woods and towns.’</p>
<p>Brave Achetes, and our forefather Aeneas, their spirits raised</p>
<p>by these words, had been burning to break free of the mist.</p>
<p>Achates was first to speak, saying to Aeneas: ‘Son of the goddess,</p>
<p>what intention springs to your mind? You see all’s safe,</p>
<p>the fleet and our friends have been restored to us.</p>
<p>Only one is missing, whom we saw plunged in the waves:</p>
<p>all else is in accord with your mother’s words.’</p>

<p>He’d scarcely spoken when the mist surrounding them</p>
<p>suddenly parted, and vanished in the clear air.</p>
<p>Aeneas stood there, shining in the bright daylight,</p>
<p>like a god in shoulders and face: since his mother</p>
<p>had herself imparted to her son beauty to his hair,</p>
<p>a glow of youth, and a joyful charm to his eyes:</p>
<p>like the glory art can give to ivory, or as when silver,</p>
<p>or Parian marble, is surrounded by gold.</p>
<p>Then he addressed the queen, suddenly, surprising them all,</p>
<p>saying: ‘I am here in person, Aeneas the Trojan,</p>
<p>him whom you seek, saved from the Libyan waves.</p>
<p>O Dido, it is not in our power, nor those of our Trojan race,</p>
<p>wherever they may be, scattered through the wide world,</p>
<p>to pay you sufficient thanks, you who alone have pitied</p>
<p>Troy’s unspeakable miseries, and share your city and home</p>
<p>with us, the remnant left by the Greeks, wearied</p>
<p>by every mischance, on land and sea, and lacking everything.</p>
<p>May the gods, and the mind itself conscious of right,</p>
<p>bring you a just reward, if the gods respect the virtuous,</p>
<p>if there is justice anywhere. What happy age gave birth</p>
<p>to you? What parents produced such a child?</p>
<p>Your honour, name and praise will endure forever,</p>
<p>whatever lands may summon me, while rivers run</p>
<p>to the sea, while shadows cross mountain slopes,</p>
<p>while the sky nourishes the stars.’ So saying he grasps</p>
<p>his friend Iloneus by the right hand, Serestus with the left,</p>
<p>then others, brave Gyus and brave Cloanthus.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054305">BkI:613-656 Dido Receives Aeneas</span></h3>
<p>Sidonian Dido was first amazed at the hero’s looks</p>
<p>then at his great misfortunes, and she spoke, saying:</p>
<p>‘Son of a goddess, what fate pursues you through all</p>
<p>these dangers? What force drives you to these barbarous shores?</p>

<p>to Trojan Anchises, by the waters of Phrygian Simois?</p>
<p>Indeed, I myself remember Teucer coming to Sidon,</p>
<p>exiled from his country’s borders, seeking a new kingdom</p>
<p>with Belus’s help: Belus, my father, was laying waste</p>
<p>rich Cyprus, and, as victor, held it by his authority.</p>
<p>Since then the fall of the Trojan city is known to me,</p>
<p>and your name, and those of the Greek kings.</p>
<p>Even their enemy granted the Teucrians high praise,</p>
<p>maintaining they were born of the ancient Teucrian stock.</p>
<p>So come, young lords, and enter our palace.</p>
<p>Fortune, pursuing me too, through many similar troubles,</p>
<p>willed that I would find peace at last in this land.</p>
<p>Not being unknown to evil, I’ve learned to aid the unhappy.’</p>
<p>So she speaks, and leads Aeneas into the royal house,</p>
<p>and proclaims, as well, offerings at the god’s temples.</p>
<p>She sends no less than twenty bulls to his friends</p>
<p>on the shore, and a hundred of her largest pigs with</p>
<p>bristling backs, a hundred fat lambs with the ewes,</p>
<p>and joyful gifts of wine, but the interior of the palace</p>
<p>is laid out with royal luxury, and they prepare</p>
<p>a feast in the centre of the palace: covers worked</p>
<p>skilfully in princely purple, massive silverware</p>
<p>on the tables, and her forefathers’ heroic deeds</p>
<p>engraved in gold, a long series of exploits traced</p>
<p>through many heroes, since the ancient origins of her people.</p>
<p>Aeneas quickly sends Achates to the ships</p>
<p>to carry the news to Ascanius (since a father’s love</p>
<p>won’t let his mind rest) and bring him to the city:</p>
<p>on Ascanius all the care of a fond parent is fixed.</p>
<p>He commands him to bring gifts too, snatched</p>
<p>from the ruins of Troy, a figured robe stiff with gold,</p>
<p>and a cloak fringed with yellow acanthus,</p>
<p>worn by Helen of Argos, brought from Mycenae</p>
<p>when she sailed to Troy and her unlawful marriage,</p>
<p>a wonderful gift from her mother Leda:</p>
<p>and the sceptre that Ilione, Priam’s eldest daughter,</p>
<p>once carried, and a necklace of pearls, and a double-coronet</p>
<p>of jewels and gold. Achates, hastening to fulfil</p>
<p>these commands, took his way towards the ships.</p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054306">BkI:657-694 Cupid Impersonates Ascanius</span></h3>
<p>But Venus was planning new wiles and stratagems</p>
<p>in her heart: how Cupid, altered in looks, might arrive</p>
<p>in place of sweet Ascanius, and arouse the passionate queen</p>
<p>by his gifts, and entwine the fire in her bones: truly she fears</p>
<p>the unreliability of this house, and the duplicitous Tyrians:</p>
<p>unyielding Juno angers her, and her worries increase with nightfall.</p>
<p>So she speaks these words to winged Cupid:</p>
<p>‘My son, you who alone are my great strength, my power,</p>
<p>a son who scorns mighty Jupiter’s Typhoean thunderbolts,</p>
<p>I ask your help, and humbly call on your divine will.</p>
<p>It’s known to you how Aeneas, your brother, is driven</p>
<p>over the sea, round all the shores, by bitter Juno’s hatred,</p>
<p>and you have often grieved with my grief.</p>
<p>Phoenician Dido holds him there, delaying him with flattery,</p>
<p>and I fear what may come of Juno’s hospitality:</p>
<p>at such a critical turn of events she’ll not be idle.</p>
<p>So I intend to deceive the queen with guile, and encircle</p>
<p>her with passion, so that no divine will can rescue her,</p>
<p>but she’ll be seized, with me, by deep love for Aeneas.</p>
<p>Now listen to my thoughts on how you can achieve this.</p>
<p>Summoned by his dear father, the royal child,</p>
<p>my greatest concern, prepares to go to the Sidonian city,</p>
<p>carrying gifts that survived the sea, and the flames of Troy.</p>
<p>I’ll lull him to sleep and hide him in my sacred shrine</p>
<p>on the heights of Cythera or Idalium, so he can know</p>
<p>nothing of my deceptions, or interrupt them mid-way.</p>
<p>For no more than a single night imitate his looks by art,</p>
<p>and, a boy yourself, take on the known face of a boy,</p>
<p>so that when Dido takes you to her breast, joyfully,</p>
<p>amongst the royal feast, and the flowing wine,</p>
<p>when she embraces you, and plants sweet kisses on you,</p>
<p>you’ll breathe hidden fire into her, deceive her with your poison.’</p>
<p>Cupid obeys his dear mother’s words, sets aside his wings,</p>
<p>and laughingly trips along with Iulus’s step.</p>
<p>But Venus pours gentle sleep over Ascanius’s limbs,</p>
<p>and warming him in her breast, carries him, with divine power,</p>
<p>to Idalia’s high groves, where soft marjoram smothers him</p>
<p>in flowers, and the breath of its sweet shade.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054307">BkI:695-722 Cupid Deceives Dido</span></h3>
<p>Now, obedient to her orders, delighting in Achetes as guide,</p>
<p>Cupid goes off carrying royal gifts for the Tyrians.</p>
<p>When he arrives the queen has already settled herself</p>
<p>in the centre, on her golden couch under royal canopies.</p>
<p>Now our forefather Aeneas and the youth of Troy</p>
<p>gather there, and recline on cloths of purple.</p>
<p>Servants pour water over their hands: serve bread</p>
<p>from baskets: and bring napkins of smooth cloth.</p>
<p>Inside there are fifty female servants, in a long line,</p>
<p>whose task it is to prepare the meal, and tend the hearth fires:</p>
<p>a hundred more, and as many pages of like age,</p>
<p>to load the tables with food, and fill the cups.</p>
<p>And the Tyrians too are gathered in crowds through the festive</p>
<p>halls, summoned to recline on the embroidered couches.</p>
<p>They marvel at Aeneas’s gifts, marvel at Iulus,</p>
<p>the god’s brilliant appearance, and deceptive words,</p>
<p>at the robe, and the cloak embroidered with yellow acanthus.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Phoenician above all, doomed to future ruin,</p>
<p>cannot pacify her feelings, and catches fire with gazing,</p>
<p>stirred equally by the child and by the gifts.</p>
<p>He, having hung in an embrace round Aeneas’s neck,</p>
<p>and sated the deceived father’s great love,</p>
<p>seeks out the queen. Dido, clings to him with her eyes</p>
<p>and with her heart, taking him now and then on her lap,</p>
<p>unaware how great a god is entering her, to her sorrow.</p>
<p>But he, remembering his Cyprian mother’s wishes,</p>
<p>begins gradually to erase all thought of Sychaeus,</p>
<p>and works at seducing her mind, so long unstirred,</p>
<p>and her heart unused to love, with living passion.</p>
<p class="line-break"></p>

<h3><span id="anchor_Toc535054308">BkI:723-756 Dido Asks for Aeneas’s Story</span></h3>
<p>At the first lull in the feasting, the tables were cleared,</p>
<p>and they set out vast bowls, and wreathed the wine with garlands.</p>
<p>Noise filled the palace, and voices rolled out across the wide halls:</p>
<p>bright lamps hung from the golden ceilings,</p>
<p>and blazing candles dispelled the night.</p>
<p>Then the queen asked for a drinking-cup, heavy</p>
<p>with gold and jewels, that Belus and all Belus’s line</p>
<p>were accustomed to use, and filled it</p>
<p>with wine. Then the halls were silent. She spoke:</p>
<p>‘Jupiter, since they say you’re the one who creates</p>
<p>the laws of hospitality, let this be a happy day</p>
<p>for the Tyrians and those from Troy,</p>
<p>and let it be remembered by our children.</p>
<p>Let Bacchus, the joy-bringer, and kind Juno be present,</p>
<p>and you, O Phoenicians, make this gathering festive.’</p>
<p>She spoke and poured an offering of wine onto the table,</p>
<p>and after the libation was the first to touch the bowl to her lips,</p>
<p>then she gave it to Bitias, challenging him: he briskly drained</p>
<p>the brimming cup, drenching himself in its golden fullness,</p>
<p>then other princes drank. Iolas, the long-haired, made</p>
<p>his golden lyre resound, he whom great Atlas taught.</p>
<p>He sang of the wandering moon and the sun’s labours,</p>
<p>where men and beasts came from, and rain and fire,</p>
<p>of Arcturus, the rainy Hyades, the two Bears:</p>
<p>why the winter suns rush to dip themselves in the sea,</p>
<p>and what delay makes the slow nights linger.</p>
<p>The Tyrians redoubled their applause, the Trojans too.</p>
<p>And unfortunate Dido, she too spent the night</p>
<p>in conversation, and drank deep of her passion,</p>
<p>asking endlessly about Priam and Hector:</p>
<p>now about the armour that Memnon, son of the Dawn,</p>
<p>came with to Troy, what kind were Diomed’s horses,</p>
<p>how great was Achilles. ‘But come, my guest, tell us</p>
<p>from the start all the Greek trickery, your men’s mishaps,</p>
<p>and your wanderings: since it’s the seventh summer now</p>
<p>that brings you here, in your journey, over every land and sea.’</p>

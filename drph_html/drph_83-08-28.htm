<P>        Past Edmonton, the countryside is very gently rolling
with few vistas. At first, there is forest and a few farms and
then, further east, more farms and islands of trees, mostly
aspen. The holdings look smaller, more confined than the
spacious ranches and grain farms of the south. The soil is black
and the sloughs have a margin of very dark, almost black reeds.
The light itself seems to have a different quality; the sky is
bright overhead, but the colours of the land are subdued. This
is the kind of terrain that reminds me of our kinship with the
Russians.  I slump down in the car seat and do a Slavic brood
on my two lost rolls of film.
<P>        We turn south off the main highway to Manitou Lake in
search of a campsite.  When I was a child, my father told me
wondrous tales of swimming in a salt lake somewhere on the
prairies where he was stationed during the war. Then, more
recently, I read a newspaper article about Manitou Lake and
determined to see for myself. The town is a seedy remnant of a
once popular resort. Undeterred, we head for the municipal beach
to try out the water. It is amazingly buoyant, especially to
someone who is used to struggling to stay afloat in fresh water;
you bob high above the surface without the least effort.  But
after paddling around wide-eyed for a few moments, we begin
wondering what to do next. It is a novelty, but not a very rich
one; the attention wanders. 
<P>        "I wonder what things were like in the old days," says
Merle. "Aunt Pearl talks about the place in disgust."
<P>        "Well," say I, "at one time, there was a brine shrimp
fishery on the lake. Quite buoyant too, until the competition
put them under." 
<P>        Back on shore again, we locate a shower which operates
from a tank of cold, fresh water.   We shoo away the children
who are trying to drain it dry for the sheer joy of seeing the
water flow. I flush out the salty water Merle has splashed
in my eyes.  Rinsed clean of mineral deposits, we return to our
campsite.

Odometer: 136823
departed: 8:40
arrived : 16:10 at Lynch's Point, Manitoba
<P>          Lost an hour.
<P>
<P>        We are awakened by the sun streaming into the tent.
Roosters are crowing on the neighbouring farms.  Before dawn we
heard the cooing of doves.   Breakfast free-association: the
water at this campsite is cloudy; the sky too is cloudy with a
high cirrus, but the coffee seems unaffected. 
<P>        We have lunch at Saltcoats, Sask., in the village park
beside a small lake.   We sit at a shady picnic table and
watch two young mothers watching a couple of children play
on the swings.  We wonder if little Darlene and young Robert
will someday be mommies and daddies who will sit on a park
bench in Saltcoats, Sask. and watch people watching
children play on the swings.
<P>
<P>                The clouds gather, the rain falls and the drops
<P>        thereof gather into streams; the streams make their way
<P>        down from the everlasting hills unto which I lift mine
<P>        everloving eyes; the rivers run into the sea and the sea
<P>        is not filled; from thence the waters return to the
<P>        heavens from whence they came. Amen.
<P>
<P>        The park at Lynch's Point turns out to be at the end of
15 kilometers of gravel road and nearly deserted. Only 13
campsites are occuppied out of 100.  But it has beautiful lawns
and a narrow sandy shore, shelving gradually out beyond the
reeds. There is foam on the beach (the natural kind) and we lie
in the shallows revelling in the warm water. 
<P>        We go for a walk out into the marsh where a canal
for launching pleasure boats had been cut through the jungle of
reeds.  Extensive hay fields on the landward side, a few
mosquitoes, and a distant gunshot report every few minutes from
some bird-scaring device.  Out on the lake: no land is visible,
no sign of the opposite side, not a sail to be seen, low,
receding shores, green on either hand.  This is the wet prairie;
we are far from the gullies and sagebrush of the Missouri.
<P>        Sitting round the campfire that evening (still burning
Parks Canada firewood from Glacier Camp, Alberta) we are
seranaded by the most incredible whine of insects in the bushes.
At first we try putting our fingers in our ears and swallowing
hard in case the sensation is purely internal. Then I notice
that the sound of the humming occasionally rises and falls in
pitch like a sort of hiccup. Somethimes I can trigger this
effect by clapping my hands. It challenges the imagination to
speculate how they can all hiccup simultaneously.   As it gets
dark, we prepare for sleep and the noise outside the tent
seemed to grow even louder; it is difficult to believe the sound
is not coming from traffic on some busy highway, but we are
miles from the nearest major road.  In spite of the din, we get
to sleep and receive only a few bites.

Odometer: 137208
Departed: 8:13
Arrived : 17:58  at Inwood P.P., Ontario
<P>
<P>        We awake to the cooing of doves - a vapid, pallid sort
of music. Why the dove should have been chosen to represent
Peace is beyond me; the sound is soothing but characterless and
verges on the idiotic. How about the tweeting of the Dickey Bird
instead? Now that IS sweet. It reminds you of apple-cheeked
girls with pig-tails, gathering flowers and spreading gingham
table cloths for a picnic in the meadow. 
<P>        The sun rises above the trees and strikes the
dewy grass.  A yellow flower we picked last night on the marsh
is still fresh.  We are the first campsite up and about.
<P>        The water is so hard at Lynch's Point I have a maelstrom
of chemical reactions going on in my coffee cup.  The creamer
precipitates out in a vortex, swirling downward to lie at the
bottom of the cup in a disgusting residue. 
<P>        The humming of the insect choirs that lulled us to
sleep is gone.  Merle dreamed she got a tiny, wee baby girl and
couldn't remember how to feed it.  And remembering last night,
she couldn't recall when she'd ever heard insects ROAR.
<P>
<P>        We load up with supplies in west suburban Winnipeg and
after failing to make contact with friends and relatives we
skirt the city and head east.  I am consistently driving too
fast for road conditions and the local speed limits, e.g. 110
when the limit is 90.   But when you have these enormous
milages to cover, the temptation is there; the roads
are good and the traffic is light.
<P>
<P>        Inwood is an older park and, like many others, not too
heavily used this year. Some of the campsites are very generous
in size; they are laid out in a helter-skelter arrangement
around a lake and the setting is attractive. There is good
swimming from a pier and a sandy beach. During the evening we
hear a loon out on the lake.

Departed: 8:54
Arrived : 19:00 at Agawa Bay Campground, Ontario
<P>
<P>        Back in Thunder Bay again, we stop to look for the
original site of Fort William. We locate a plaque about 1.2 Km
up the river from its mouth. The approach of canoes coming from
the east across the lake would not have been visible to someone
standing on the boat landing. We drive out to a point at the
mouth of the Kaministiquia River, but Thunder Cape is not quite
visible. From the tip of the breakwater on the left bank, the
belly of the "Sleeping Giant" bears east. From the harbourfront
park in the northern part of the city, Thunder Cape bears almost
due south.

<P>
<P>        We camp that night at Agawa Bay.  The campground is on
a long, curving shingle beach.  You have to arrive early in
the day to get the best campsites which are just back of the
beach.  In fact, it might be worthwhile to come for several days
and then move to a better campsite on the morning of the second
day, after the exodus had begun and before the afternoon
arrivals. After supper, we go swimming in Lake Superior; the
water is quite comfortable, compared to our Pukasaw trip. 
<P>        The evening's interpretive program, consists of a
slide show and the film: "Song of the Paddle" (NFB). It is
about a family canoe trip down river to Lake Superior and along
the shore. The film is roughly done, but amusing; it reminds
me of a home movie.  A middle-aged, grey-bearded dad likes rough
water and going out on the lake in storms.   Luckily, his kids
are highly skilled at navigating rapids and the waves of Lake
Superior. They lash together two canoes to make a catamataran
and hoist a big spinnaker sail out front.  On shore, they make
camp and prepare their food amid drenching downpours and
buffeting wind.

<P>        We drive along the lower Mississagi River in the
morning: a dark, smooth-flowing body of water; a Canadian
Moldau, or so I imagine.  Some mist, then sunny, with a high,
thin sheet of cirrus. 
<P>        We stop for lunch and a swim at Chutes P.P., by this
time an old familiar stopping place on most trips to the North
Shore. 
<P>        The ferry trip is uneventful.   After the remoteness
of the west, Tobermory seems like a suburb of Toronto. It is
dark by the time we get to Wiarton.  My behind is uncomfortable.
Merle wants to get home; she drives relentlessly while I doze.
We unload our gear that night.

<P>GRecap of the Trip
-----------------
H
<P>
<P>GPhotography:
H
<P>        Used my 28 mm Vivitar wide-angle lens almost
exclusively, with a few telephoto shots of special landscape
features.   It is most inconvenient having to change lenses on
the run; you need a slave to hand you things.  I seem to think
most often in terms of relating elements of the scene together,
rather than in isolating particular features.  Perhaps a 35mm
wide-angle would be better than a 28mm if it is to be the
mainstay.  On looking at the returned pictures, I am not as
impressed with the lens as I was when using it.  The sharpness
leaves something to be desired (I think) and I have too many
shots with boring foregrounds.
<P>        The rigid camera bag is too clumsy, I need something
smaller, with slots for the lenses so things don't get tangled
up. Used the blue Air Force bag, but it is still too clumsy.
Used the tripod ONCE for setting up a time-delay shot so as to
get into a picture with Merle.
<P>        Getting in and out of the car gracefully with a camera
round the neck is a challenge.   There is the problem
of disentangling the seat belt and the camera straps.
<P>        Made a disastrous error mixing up Kodachrome 64 and
Kodachrome II, forgetting to change the film speed setting.  The
cassettes do not look different enough when you are changing
film in a hurry.  The problem is partly one of using an
unfamiliar camera, the Canon AT-1, and one I am not really
happy with. Some of my best pictures in past years were taken
with my old Practica which had no internal metering.
<P>        Kodachrome II film is too slow for all-round use.
On cloudy days or in shadowed locations, you are too often up
against shutter speed limitations.   I used the polarizing
screen only once - too much of a penalty in film speed for
Kodachrome II. The pre-labelled and pre-numbered mailers are a
good idea; they keep the films in order and mailing gets them
out of the way. The first film was already back from processing
by the time we arrived in St. Catharines. Remember, if you mail
them home over a very long trip, somebody must pick up the mail,
otherwise you will have a pile of film out on the front porch
when you return. 
<P>        Dust is a problem on back roads.   It infiltrates
absolutely everthing.   All sensitive equipment and materials
must be stored in sealed platic bags.
<P>        Need to develop a better way to coordinate notes and
pictures.   It proved quite difficult to keep even a simple log
going, let alone a description of every frame of 11 rolls of
film.  I found myself speculating about the possiblitiy of tape
recording. This might be a real advantage in a moving car where
writing is difficult at best for a passenger and impossible for
the driver. 
<P>        In retrospect, I am most conscious of the pictures I
failed to take. For instance, a series of banal shots of each
campsite would have been useful, if only as a sort of framework
to help identify and fix each day in the mind.  But of course,
only the spectacular campsites get photographed. Photographic
opportunism becomes the order of the day and continuity suffers.
This points up the need for a script, or, at least, some sort of
organized plan. It could be a complete list of the pictures
required to tell a story, or it might simply be a rough
outline which could be augmented along the way with notes and
references to the pictures already taken. It would then be
clearer, while still in transit, what was missing from the
skeleton narrative. Any glaring omissions could be remedied on
the spot, instead of agonized over when it is too late to go
back and do it over again. 
<P>        All this points up the need for a production facility en
route, either some committment to keeping a more elaborate note
book, or, possibly, a portable typewriter to compose each day's
rough draft. And, of course, to use a typewriter, even just to
rewrite the day's experiences, would require the time and
conditions to make a job of it: for instance, lighting, and a
less cramped workplace than a backpacker's tent. 
<P>
<P>
<P>GCloths:
H
<P>        I wore about 3 or 4 shirts on the whole trip and one
pair each of trousers and shorts.   Sandals are airy and
comfortable in a hot car, but far from sure-footed when you are
dashing in and out and up and down banks to get pictures.
Running shoes are the safest and most comfortable alternative
but they stink. 
<P>        We used our hiking boots, kangaroos and rain jackets for
hiking and climbing, even brought along mitts.   What you really
need for climbing are close-fitting leather gloves, buttoned at
the wrist, tough but comfortable. After hours of clambering over
rock, the hands get sore and lacerated, particularly in the
nippy air above the tree line. 
<P>
<P>
<P>GPacks, tents, equipment:
H
<P>        We often used the axe for splitting wood; the saw only
once. The main source of firewood is park woodyards.   The
unsplit cordwood or sawmill scraps - often all that is available
- are almost always too thick or too wet to burn, but they are
usually cut into convenient lengths. So what you need is some
way to split the stuff up thin enough to burn. 
<P>        The tent was adequate for sleeping but we really lived
out of the car. The foam mats are soft under the back but could
be less bulky for easier stowage in transit. A plastic sheet
inside the tent seems to keep the floor reasonably dry in case
of rain or wet ground. However, there was condensation nearly
every night in the sleeping bags and mats. This dried out in the
car with a day's driving.  Of course, if you use inflatable
matresses or other impermeable mats, all the night's
condensation will go into your sleeping bag.   One way or
another, every bit of moisture you exude from sweat or
perspiration must either go outside, through the tent's
ventilation, or condense on the cooler surfaces inside. 
<P>        The small rucksack was useful for hiking but still a bit
too small.   I must get a pair of light, internal-frame
rucksacks for the more extended climbs and those hikes which
fall short of all-in, catch-as-catch-can backpacking.
<P>        We slathered ourselves with plenty of mosquito lotion
in Manitoba and it was effective.  Didn't use the first aid kit
or the toolkit more than once or twice:  popped a few aspirins
and used the pliers to bend a wire in Merle's bra. My
calculator/calendar/stopwatch was useful for milage calculations
and keeping track of the date, but it is more vulnerable to
dampness and physical damage than a mechanical watch. 
<P>
<P>
<P>GFood:
H
<P>        Great!  Ate out of brown bags and boxes; had sandwiches
every day. It might be convenient to have a picnic hamper or
plywood field kitchen which could be lifted out of the car and
immediately placed on the picnic table. This would also help in
keeping the rear of the car neater. 
<P>
<P>
<P>GPlanning, general conception:
H
<P>        The trip turned out fairly well for such an impromtu
effort (read: no planning, we just got up and left). The station
wagon is not the most comfortable vehicle for keeping papers and
gear organized while motoring.  Found myself hankering after a
van with bucket seats. It did prove possible to see most of the
locations we wanted and get most of the pictures needed, but it
was very difficult to make notes or keep information organized.
<P>        There was too much driving, not enough time to observe,
make notes and consider.   It should be possible to write up
something like a finished draft en route while the fact are
still fresh in the memory. This points up the need for a
portable writing desk, a super briefcase, or a portable computer
to help develop a narrative on the spot. (Thought I'd never get
around to computers, eh?) 
<P>
<P>
<P>GCar:
H
<P>   The station wagon has sufficient carrying capacity for two
people, but there is a problem not being able to stow things
in the car for the duration of the trip and still get at them
easily.  Every day you must do a fair bit of unpacking and
repacking.   The bucket seats of a van would make it easier to
get at the things in back.   It would also be nice if the
vehicle had a place to sit at a level surface to read, write or
prepare food, especially when it was necessary to work inside in
case of bad weather or other reason.  A crie-de-coeur: the slick
plastic seats of our station wagon are particularly ghastly in
sweaty weather; we must cover them with something absorbent.

square cookers with hinged grills.  In Saskatchewan (or was
it Alberta - the provinces blur together) we excercised our
wits by learning to use a model with fancy pivoted grid and
a separate cooking surface, all mounted on a slice of metal
culvert.

<I>D224-006 09-06-05</I> - <B>Quito arrival, surrounded by mountains.</B><xxx>

<BR> This view from our hotel room, greeted us the morning after arrival in
Quito, Ecuador. We're impressed by the city's location with mountains on all
sides. Contrary to richer cities, the low-rent districts are often higher up
the mountainsides, with a better view.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-008.jpeg">
<I>D224-008 09-06-05</I> - <B>Hotel Dann Carlton, Quito.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Dann Carlton is a medium-sized hotel. Owned by a Senora Spivak. A
Columbian, we're told. Merle once knew a Spivak family in Toronto. The hotel
is named after one of the tribes of Israel.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-007.jpeg">
<I>D224-007 09-06-05</I> - <B>A major Ecuadorean export, roses.</B><xxx>

<BR> Reproduction period furniture in the lobby. Plenty of English speakers on
staff. Fresh roses, in large displays. Roses are a major Ecuadorean export,
shipped all over the world by air. Russians prefer the long-stemmed variety.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-010.jpeg">
<I>D224-010 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Not much scent. Too bad. Or would that lead to sensory overkill with so
many clustered together?

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-014.jpeg">
<I>D224-014 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> "TAME" airlines as opposed to "WILD" airlines? Reminds us of Hamilton, Mount
Hope airport. The outdoor entry to the airplane, up a stairway humanizes
aviation, but needs good weather.
<BR>

<I>D224-023 09-06-05</I> - <B>Quito from the air.</B><xxx>

<BR> Liftoff for the Galapagos. Our takeoff runway is to the right. Taller
buildings and hotels on the left. The football stadium, the red and green
oval, bottom left.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-028.jpeg">
<I>D224-028 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> An airport with landscaping and a cactus garden. Really more of a landing
strip than an air terminal. Though the Galapagos is part of Ecuador, we
proceed to yet another careful check of documents and luggage.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-031.jpeg">
<I>D224-031 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> They don't want illegal immigrants of either the human or the ecological
kind.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-033.jpeg">
<I>D224-033 09-06-05</I> - <B>Our first seal of many.</B><xxx>

<BR> We're transported by mini-bus from airport to harbour. Going have to learn
to tell the difference between seals and sea lions. Ears, says Merle.
<P><B>June 5 Transfer to MV Santa Cruz</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-035.jpeg">
<I>D224-035 09-06-05</I> - <B>Our first Zodiac jaunt of many.</B><xxx>

<BR> 10 or 15 Passengers per boatload. The town has several thousand population
but no piers for large ships. Everything has to be ferried in and out of
harbour in small boats.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-039.jpeg">
<I>D224-039 09-06-05</I> - <B>Yes, well ...</B><xxx>

<BR> Do these people look apprehensive, or eager? The dark, reflective sunglasses
are a good foil for the photographer. You can read anything you want into the
reflection -- your own anxiety or excitement.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-040.jpeg">
<I>D224-040 09-06-05</I> - <B>This will be ...</B><xxx>

<BR> One of the guides fills us in on a few details about our accomodation. He's
Italian-speaking and eventually leads a group from Italy.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-042.jpeg">
<I>D224-042 09-06-05</I> - <B>Your home for the next 3 nights.</B><xxx>

<BR> If this is the Santa Cruz, it looks like some of us may have to sleep on the
roof.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-043.jpeg">
<I>D224-043 09-06-05</I> - <B>Just kidding. THIS is it.</B><xxx>

<BR> THERE'S the Santa Cruz. What a relief. Looks like a crowd has already
gathered at the bar on the rear upper deck. Happy hour starts early in these
latitudes.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-044.jpeg">
<I>D224-044 09-06-05</I> - <B>The MV Santa Cruz.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz is registered in Guayaquil, 1675 gross tonnage, length 72
metres, accomodation for 90 passengers, 2 x 1620 bhp engines, cruising speed
13 knots.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-047.jpeg">
<I>D224-047 09-06-05</I> - <B>The crew welcomes us on board.</B><xxx>

<BR> 60 crew and 7 guides. Steerage class cabins are behind round ports on lower
deck. Toffs located on the deck above, away from the engine.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-048.jpeg">
<I>D224-048 09-06-05</I> - <B>Another Zodiac of tourists motors out.</B><xxx>

<BR> Looking back at Puerto Moreno, San Christobal Island.  The airport just over
the hill on the horizon. ... Is that a deckchair I see? Doesn't seem to need
rearranging though.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-051.jpeg">
<I>D224-051 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> 14 passengers, 1 crew on the last zodiac out from shore.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-052.jpeg">
<I>D224-052 09-06-05</I> - <B>Plus our luggage.</B><xxx>

<BR>  Our own bags, blue and red, are visible on the near side. The red one is
Merle's. Lucky it didn't fall overboard.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-053.jpeg">
<I>D224-053 09-06-05</I> - <B>The Zodiacs are hoisted on board.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz carries 6, plus a glass bottom boat.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-061.jpeg">
<I>D224-061 09-06-05</I> - <B>And stacked three high.</B><xxx>

<BR> The messy-looking rope skirts are to protect the boat's air-inflated
rubber hull against collisions with rocks during landings on shore.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-055.jpeg">
<I>D224-055 09-06-05</I> - <B>We head out of the anchorage.</B><xxx>

<BR> The wind is fair for France. Or, at least, for a trip down the coast
to Cerro Brujo, our afternoon destination. Meantime, a bite of lunch.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-059.jpeg">
<I>D224-059 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> This is what a 13 knot bow-wave looks like. Quite a commotion of water. The
Santa Cruz makes most of her mileage at lunch time and in the evenings. This
positions us for our morning and afternoon excursions.
<P><B>June 5, pm  Wet landing, Cerro Brujo.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-068.jpeg">
<I>D224-068 09-06-05</I> - <B>"Cormorants", ready for first landing.</B><xxx>

<BR>We're divided into groups such as "Sea Lions" and "Cormorants". Each group,
with a guide, fits into a single Zodiac. The small groups are easier for the
guide to talk to and reduce the impact on trails and beaches ashore.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-071.jpeg">
<I>D224-071 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Cerro Brujo is just down the coast from Puerto Moreno. We keep a sharp
lookout for critters as we motor shoreward. D'you think those are birds in
the right hand cave? Or merely bird-shaped rocks?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-084.jpeg">
<I>D224-084 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> A "wet landing". No pier, over the side and over our ankles. The reef
offshore moderates the larger breakers, so the zodiac is stable. Wow, strange
island in the offing.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-102.jpeg">
<I>D224-102 09-06-05</I> - <B>"Kicker Rock".</B><xxx>

<BR> Looks like a boot. But the kick would have to be backward, with the heel. A
volcanic vestige, eroding in the sea. We're at the older, eastern side of the
archipelago.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-088.jpeg">
<I>D224-088 09-06-05</I> - <B>A trek to the beach.</B><xxx>

<BR> From the zodiac landing area to the swimming beach. The first boatload
already exploring water and shore. This is the 1st island Darwin visited. He
slept on shore and marvelled at the volcanic cones inland.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-091.jpeg">
<I>D224-091 09-06-05</I> - <B>Welcoming committee asleep.</B><xxx>

<BR> Any more relaxed and it would spread out like a puddle and
sink into the sand.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-096.jpeg">
<I>D224-096 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz has supplied us with swim fins, goggles and snorkels. The
zodiac offshore stands ready to keep an eye on the swimmers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-100a.jpeg">
<I>D224-100a 09-06-05</I> - <B>One for the Beach portfolio.</B><xxx>

<BR> This is one of the world's more idyllic beaches. No high-rise resort
hotels. No palm trees. No little thatched cabanas. No cliches.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-104.jpeg">
<I>D224-104 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> A few figures wander down at the far, southern, end of the beach. We've been
warned by the naturalist not to go farther. They don't want to have to send out
search parties or have us trampling endangered species without supervision.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-107.jpeg">
<I>D224-107 09-06-05</I> - <B>Looking back toward the landing.</B><xxx>

<BR> Looking back toward the swimming area. A seal or sea-lion
is asleep on the rocks, left.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-109a.jpeg">
<I>D224-109a 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> "Kicker Rock" again.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-110.jpeg">
<I>D224-110 09-06-05</I> - <B>Cerro Brujo.</B><xxx>

<BR> Internet translation of "Cerro Brujo" is "Wizard Hill". It has a dark,
portentous quality that certainly dominates the beach area. Other parts of
San Christobal Is. are flatter, less dramatic.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-111.jpeg">
<I>D224-111 09-06-05</I> - <B>The Santa Cruz.</B><xxx>

<BR> The Santa Cruz waits offshore for our return. The cooks are preparing
supper, no doubt. A low afternoon sun. It gets dark about 6:15pm at this
latitude.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-112.jpeg">
<I>D224-112 09-06-05</I> - <B>Derek savours the beachcombing life.</B><xxx>

<BR>Beach camping might be attractive. But not sure how you'd survive here, if
you really were marooned. No fresh water that we could see. No edible
vegetation or fruit. You'd have to munch critters, if you could catch them.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-117.jpeg">
<I>D224-117 09-06-05</I> - <B>Merle tries snorkeling.</B><xxx>

<BR> Gear supplied by the Santa Cruz from lockers on the upper deck. Every size
flipper was available up to 13 for Derek.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-119.jpeg">
<I>D224-119 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Merle, see any jetsam, flotsam, fish, turtles? Pieces of eight? Dubloons?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-121.jpeg">
<I>D224-121 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Derek is unable to use the snorkel because his eyglasses won't fit inside.
Being nearsighted underwater is even more useless than being nearsighted on
land..
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-123.jpeg">

<I>D224-126 09-06-05</I> - <B>Merle and her (his) shadow.</B><xxx>

<BR> On a relentless quest for photo-ops, Derek picks out a damsel who is
definitely NOT in distress. He guesses that she's in her natural element.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-136.jpeg">
<I>D224-136 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-142.jpeg">
<I>D224-142 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The sand is so fine it mixes even with small waves. Almost a slurry of sand,
water and bubbles.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-143.jpeg">
<I>D224-143 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-147.jpeg">
<I>D224-147 09-06-05</I> - <B>Shadows lengthen.</B><xxx>

<BR> Moon-rise over this wind-blown dune, back of the beach, reminds us that the
afternoon's excursion is nearly over.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-148.jpeg">
<I>D224-148 09-06-05</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Time to gather our flippers, snorkels and damp towels and head back to the
zodiac landing.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-150.jpeg">
<I>D224-150 09-06-05</I> - <B>Back to the Santa Cruz.</B><xxx>

<BR> A fast ride back. And noisy. Climbing up the gangway of the Santa Cruz, we
have our feet hosed down so we don't bring beach sand on board. Partly for
ecological reasons, partly to keep sediment out of the ship's drains.
<P><B>June 6, am  Espanola (Hood) Is.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-155.jpeg">
<I>D224-155 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The zodiacs are lowered for another excursion. We're stationed off Punta
Suarez, Espanola Island. The 1st island Darwin set eyes on. He didn't land.
But Captain Fitzroy of the Beagle send out a boat to explore the shoreline.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-157.jpeg">
<I>D224-157 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Other tourists are already on the point. The waves are bigger today. But
you don't feel them much on the open water. Nearing shore the shelving bottom
lifts the water more dramatically.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-158.jpeg">
<I>D224-158 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Glimpses of plentiful animal life among the rocks: crabs and iguanas.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-160.jpeg">
<I>D224-160 09-06-06</I> - <B>Today, a dry landing.</B><xxx>

<BR> Here you see why a zodiac needs those rope blankets on the
bow. The driver holds it onto the pier with the engine running. The bow
takes a steady grinding from the rocks and concrete.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-163.jpeg">
<I>D224-163 09-06-06</I> - <B>Marine iguanas match the rocks.</B><xxx>

<BR> Why the iguanas should have evolved an almost chameleon-like match to the
rocks is unclear. No serious predation here except for the more vulnerable
babies.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-164.jpeg">
<I>D224-164 09-06-06</I> - <B>Don't step on somebody's tail.</B><xxx>

<BR> Do they cuddle together for warmth, companionship, or are they
just oblivious to each other?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-168.jpeg">
<I>D224-168 09-06-06</I> - <B>Assertive sea lion. The "Beachmaster".</B><xxx>

<BR> One of our "Cormorants" attempted a close-up picture. They got rushed and
barked at. But keep 10 ft away and they ignore you.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-171.jpeg">
<I>D224-171 09-06-06</I> - <B>Blue-footed boobies.</B><xxx>

<BR> These two Blue-footed Boobies are clearly up to something. They have
ritualized movements, almost a kind of dance.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-172.jpeg">
<I>D224-172 09-06-06</I> - <B>Friendly, curious.</B><xxx>

<BR> They notice the tourists. It almost seems as if they're performing for
our benefit.

<I>D224-176 09-06-06</I> - <B>Oh-oh, mating ritual starting up.</B><xxx>

<BR> The two at bottom go into their dance of love. The third one at top was
trying to get the female's attention, but, sadly, was ignored.
<BR><P><B>June 6, am  Espanola (Hood) Is.</B>

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-179.jpeg">
<I>D224-179 09-06-06</I> - <B>Marine iguanas.</B><xxx>

<BR> They seem to be basking on the sand. Get up sluggards. Whatever happened to
"Nature, red in tooth and claw?" Maybe iguanas simply groove on tropic
beaches, just like some snow-bird travellers I could name.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-180.jpeg">
<I>D224-180 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> Seems like beauty is in the eye of the beholden. I'm beholden to
you, Merle, for bringing me to this place.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-181.jpeg">
<I>D224-181 09-06-06</I> - <B>Not a land iguana?</B><xxx>

<BR> Probably the Espanola Lava Lizard according to the Metropolitan
Touring guidebook, p37. The travel literature provided by this company is
outstanding. And written in good English too.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-184.jpeg">
<I>D224-184 09-06-06</I> - <B>Marine iguanas.</B><xxx>

<BR> I can't believe that this kind of cosy pile-up can be explained by anything
other than fellow-feeling. To us they seem so ugly, we can hardly believe
they might be capable of mutual toleration, or even affection.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-185.jpeg">
<I>D224-185 09-06-06</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR> The white patches are probably salt-encrusted moulting skin. Each time they
emerge from the ocean, water evaporates, leaving behind salt crystals.
Another reason why they often seem to have a white cap is that they have a
way of purging excess salt from their systems by sneezing it out of their
nostrils.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D224/D224-187.jpeg">
<I>D224-187 09-06-06</I> - <B>Staying near the water for foraging.</B><xxx>

<BR> They feed on weed in the shallows near shore. The rest of the time is spent
resting or ... you know. But we didn't see any of that kind of behaviour.
Odd. What else is there to do in paradise?
<BR>

<P><rt-clk> Notes on high-altitude hiking.</B>
<BR>You might well ask: why do people go on these trips? They cost a lot of
effort, sometimes also money. They offer very little physical comfort.
There's often the chance of bad weather with no option to retreat to a
comfortable vehicle or hotel. The element of hazard may be significant.
Medical assistance is usually far off, sometimes non-existant. So if you have
a heart attack on the summit of Kilimanjaro, helicopter rescue will be out of
the question due to altitude alone, not to mention lack of cell-phone
coverage. Then there's the fitness issue. You can't, or shouldn't, tackle a
multi-day trek, without a lot of preparation, which can be time-consuming and
boring. You don't have to bicycle laps up the hydro hill every day for a
month in order to get ready for a Caribean cruise. And I won't even bother to
go into the matter of specialized equipment, such as hiking boots, tents,
etc., that may be useless for any other activity.
<BR>
<BR>So WHY then? ... I have to admit, the difficulties do loom larger the older
we get. But we learn to cut corners to keep going as long as possible. For
instance, kayak trips with no portages. Treking with the added expense of
porters to carry the heavier luggage. Any scheme to experience again those
rare magic moments that you just can't get without total immersion in the
natural environment.  But this is not to claim that you can't get your quota of
magic moments some other way, only that there IS a special rapport that
outdoor trippers often experience.
<BR>
<BR>I recall a day on Mt. Washington, New Hampshire. This is a 6000ft peak with
some long ascents of perhaps 4500ft from the trailheads in the surrounding
valleys. Starting at 7am we reached the summit, which was clothed in a
freezing cloud, and at about 1pm started down the opposite side. A few
hundred feet down the trail the cloud disappeared, the sun came out and the
air warmed up. This location overlooks the famous Crawford path, which in the
White Mountains of New Hampshire traverses bare ridges of rock for miles and
miles above the tree-line. The view is a perfect metaphor for the human
condition, and a very attractive metaphor, when the sun is shining. Along
this metaphor hundreds of hikers were making their way up and down the trail.
That trail being narrow, essentially single track, we had to step round a
constant stream of people still toiling their way upward. This was at an
altitude of more than 5000ft, no mean eminence in New England. Those still
ascending had come a long way up.
<BR>
<BR>We hadn't expected to see so many people, but the really odd thing was that
practically all of them greeted us like long-lost friends. "How've you been.
Where are you from? Lovely weather. Doesn't it make you glad to be alive?"
They weren't smoking dope or tippling from whiskey-filled canteens, these
people were ecstatic about the stunning views, the trail that went on to the
limit of visibility, the endless ridges of blue mountains in the distance,
one behind the other, the beaming sunshine, their ability to put out
extraordinary effort and still feel happy and fit while doing so, all the
while sensing the comradship of companions on the route, united in a
common project. I'm told that similar ecstatic behaviour can be observed at
rock concerts and hockey games. 
<BR>
<BR>There are also some essentially perceptual joys to be had while treking at
higher altitudes. Vision. You can see long distances. This sounds obvious
and simplistic. But in our ordinary experience we seldom see very far,
vision is interrupted in every direction by the interior walls of houses,
workplaces, vehicles, and outoors by the streetscape. Even in a "natural"
environment, surrounding trees and hedges preclude the long view. To be able
to see significant details at a very long distance can be almost like a
spiritual revelation. Westerners complain that they miss it. Easterners
don't quite know what they're talking about.
<BR>
<BR>Its not enough to just look at the view. You can drive a car to the summit of
Mt Washington. Sure the outlook is impressive that way. But you can't see it
as part of your own personal itinerary in life if you only view it
vicariously and don't take the opportunity to wander in its vastness.
<BR>
<BR>But there's also something special about experiencing up close the very bulk
and mass of rocks, cliffs and peaks, forests seen as whole communities of
trees, clouds that actually brush past on your own level. Ordinarily we see
most things in close detail, as items, as figures, against a negligible
ground. Way up there, you have moments of seeing the world, not only in terms
of a collection of individual details, but as the very background of your
existence. Here we can sometimes approach, if our blood sugar levels are
calibrated correctly, an almost religious experience. You begin to glimpse
the vast body of a mountain as underlying, sustaining, as providential of new
and challenging experiences. Almost ... as a deity. You could be immortal for
a few precious hours.
<BR><P><B>June 18 day 1  The hike begins.</B>{day1}

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-162.jpeg">
<I>D226-162 09-06-18</I> - <B>Piscacucho</B><xxx>

<BR> We begin at Piscacucho, on the Machu Picchu Railroad. Kilometer 82. Our mini
bus, which has driven us this morning from our hotel in Cuzco, drops us near
the railroad station. We assemble in a staging area with a wonderful view.
The Urubamba River is below. The Inca Trail is on the opposite side.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-163.jpeg">
<I>D226-163 09-06-18</I> - <B>The porters sort out their packs.</B><xxx>

<BR>The blue bags contain all our tents, sleeping bags, mats, food, fuel,
eating utensils and everything the porters individually might need. We carry
our own personal gear, such as cameras, water, extra clothing and documents.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-166.jpeg">
<I>D226-166 09-06-18</I> - <B>Weighing the loads.</B><xxx>

<BR>The loads are checked at the weighing station on the right. This ensures
that no one is carrying more or less than their fair share. The porter in the
red shirt on the far side is actually hefting a propane tank.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-165.jpeg">
<I>D226-165 09-06-18</I> - <B>The group. Ineke, 3rd from right.</B><xxx>

<BR>Here's the group ready to set out. Left to right: Tim, Merle, Ian, Franca,
Ineke our travel agent, Carole, Derek. Full of excitement and bubbles. Here
we're standing beside the Machu Picchu Railroad track, with the river in
back.
<BR>You can see by that lighter line along the bank that the level is low. But
the flow is still impressive.  The Urubamba is a tributary of the Amazon.
Here, we're on the Atlantic, not the Pacific watershed.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/d230/d230-080.jpeg">
<I>d230-080 09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole D: Bridge across the Urubamba</B><xxx>

<BR>This is a wire-rope suspension bridge that we're about to cross. The hiking
group is on the right. The green gate on the left is where we undergo another
security check to make sure our papers are in order and all our fees paid.
It's not a bridge over troubled waters. The Urubamba seemed very happy that
day. At least to a group of hikers champing at the bit to get started.
<BR>Taken from the middle of the bridge looking down into the Urubamba River. The
mountains on the horizon lead us forward into the interior where we'll spend
the next four days walking.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-171.jpeg">
<I>D226-171 09-06-18</I> - <B>Bromeliads will be our companions.</B><xxx>

<BR>We see some of the plant life that will be common along the trail. The dry
brown grass indicates the end of the growing season in these parts. Mid June
is midwinter.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-172.jpeg">
<I>D226-172 09-06-18</I> - <B>Farm terraces along Machu Picchu RR.</B><xxx>

<BR>Now we're fairly begun. Those terraces opposite might be of Inca origin. But
the farmers of today are more inclined to the type of tillage you see in the
field beside the river. This well-groomed plot awaits the coming planting
season. you can see signs of farm roads and paths on the hillside. Reminds me
of how much you can discover in a photo that you didn't see at the time.
<BR>The mountains become our companions. Giant rocks beside the trail gives us
the feeling of being planted on the bosom of Mother Earth.
<BR>And impressive bosoms they are too, judging from those crags on the other
side of the river. We're into some serious mountain country now. Agriculture
is confined between high valley walls.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-175.jpeg">
<I>D226-175 09-06-18</I> - <B>Our guide, Angelo.</B><xxx>

<BR>Angelo, our guide, introduces himself. Here he's expounding on safety
procedures, not getting lost, and the general context of our excursion. We
thought him a bit glib at first, but we soon come to like him a great deal.
His english is quite fluent.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-176.jpeg">
<I>D226-176 09-06-18</I> - <B>Residences along the trail.</B><xxx>

<BR>The trail at this point isn't exactly wilderness. We find several lodges like
this soliciting tourists along the way. It's uncertain how you would contact
the proprietors to make a reservation, but a place like this would do nicely
for a few lazy days of downtime or recuperation.
<P><B>June 18 Day 1.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-177.jpeg">
<I>D226-177 09-06-18</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>The clouds are cooperating with the photographers in the group. The plants
along the way a beginning to look more and more desert-like.
<BR>Here's a kind of plant that Derek sympathises with. He doesn't think that the
tree is bearded because it's an old codger of a tree. This is probably some kind
of moss that flourishes in wetter weather and dries up in the off season.
<BR>We're truly launched. The trail is a beaten dirt path, typical of this
section, clearly marked, no ambiguity at all. We see those snow clad peaks
and wonder if we'll ever again be able to climb that high.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-180.jpeg">
<I>D226-180 09-06-18</I> - <B>Former cochineal bug.</B><xxx>

<BR>Angelo stops at a large cactus plant, picks off a bit of white fluff. He
mashes it against his palm producing this brilliant red smear. It's the
cochineal bug that used to be harvested for dye. Still has limited use in the
cosmetics industry.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-181.jpeg">
<I>D226-181 09-06-18</I> - <B>Cochinal bugs on cactus.</B><xxx>

<BR>The bug grows on a kind of prickly pear cactus. It feed on the cactus but
doesn't seem to harm it. I don't think I'd like to collect cochineal for a
living, what with those fearsome spines to stick into your fingers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-182.jpeg">
<I>D226-182 09-06-18</I> - <B>Inca trail refreshment stand.</B><xxx>

<BR>Small villages line the trail. Local women sell drinks and snacks to the
hikers. They carry their wares to the booths on their backs. Angelo buys us
prickly-pear cactus fruit. Delicious. You can sometimes buy it at home in the
supermarket. Mind you don't pick up nearly invisible spines from the skin.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-183.jpeg">
<I>D226-183 09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole and Tim.</B><xxx>

<BR>Derek takes his own picture in Carole's sunglasses. Ton-ton Macoute style,
like Papadoc Duvalier's henchpeople in Haiti used to wear. They reflect back
the bemused stare of the uneasy onlooker, revealing nothing of the wearer's
intentions.
<BR>Well, Derek wasn't really feeling obstinate, like a donkey. Just, feeling
a little quiet noticing the fatigue of the trail on the first day out.
<BR>Well, perhaps Derek isn't quite so prickly. But oddly enough, for his
retirement party, many years ago, he got a cactus that was just as well-armed
as this tree. If this was a hint, he's taken a long time to get the point.
<BR>Ok. That was a weak attempt at trailside humour. But one or two people
sometimes laugh. There's nothing like a hike or a camping trip to help you
get to know people. I advise it for all those contemplating marriage.
<BR>Another typical trail view, rising higher. An Agave plant. Sends up a tall
fruiting stalk and then the plant dies or goes into dormancy. The seeds,
presumeably, get spread by birds and animals looking for a snack.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-189.jpeg">
<I>D226-189 09-06-18</I> - <B>The Inca trail is also ...</B><xxx>

<BR>The Inca Trail isn't only for hikers. It's a highway for villagers going
about their business. Although not suitable for wheeled vehicles, it carries
a steady stream of local people and pack animals bearing loads of produce
and supplies.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-190.jpeg">
<I>D226-190 09-06-18</I> - <B>A commercial corridor.</B><xxx>

<BR>This pack train is followed by a young lad on a pony somewhere round
the corner up ahead. The animals seem to know exactly where they're
going. Don't deviate right or left and pay no attention to the hikers.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-193.jpeg">
<I>D226-193 09-06-18</I> - <B>The trail rises.</B><xxx>

<BR>Gaining altitude now. The landscape spreads out as we rise. Less habitation.
That cut on the far side of the valley may be the Machu Picchu Railroad. An
Inca ruin lies beside the tracks on the left side of the river. We're
beginning to be intoxicated by the open air and the heights surrounding us.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-199.jpeg">
<I>D226-199 09-06-18</I> - <B>Still a few hamlets.</B><xxx>

<BR>A rest stop with the villagers selling snacks. Ineke has a one-sided
conversation with that little kid on the right. He accepted a banana for a
snack.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-200.jpeg">
<I>D226-200 09-06-18</I> - <B>Hiker rest stop.</B><xxx>

<BR>A guide or hiker from another group. This seems to be a regular stopping
place for most tourists coming through.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-202.jpeg">
<I>D226-202 09-06-18</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Two of the ladies who maintain this rest stop. The one on the right has the
typical garb of Quechua mountain women, the fedora hat and petticoats. The
woman on the left, who was in charge of the refreshment stand, dresses like
us. Except for the lack of hiking boots.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-203.jpeg">
<I>D226-203 09-06-18</I> - <B>Portal. What's inside?</B><xxx>

<BR>A picturesque doorway for Derek's portal collection. I wonder what's behind
it. Gardening tools, grain storage, or do people liv<e> in there?
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/d230/d230-087.jpeg">
<I>d230-087 09-06-18</I> - <B>Carole D: Other facilities.</B><xxx>

<BR>Aha! We can guess what's inside that door. We don't go in to check, but we
suspect that the owner is probably trying to salt away the greenbacks for her
retirement fund. Or maybe a holiday in Regional Niagara.
<P><B>June 18 Lunch stop.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-206.jpeg">
<I>D226-206 09-06-18</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>At last, a lunch stop at a regular campsite. One of the group is already
nibbling on the grass. Looks like the site has hydro, no mean achievement
this high up in the mountains.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-204.jpeg">
<I>D226-204 09-06-18</I> - <B>Campground.</B><xxx>

<BR>Our blue dining tent, with members of the group on the right. The stream may
be fed from Inca channels in the upper mountains collecting rain and
meltwater. Far right, guides are doing dishes, thankfully, upstream from the
donkey.
<BR>Waiting for lunch. Those are the blue-wrapped packs of our porters in the
foreground. We loll around, take pictures and chat, enjoying the sunshine of a
perfect day.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-209.jpeg">
<I>D226-209 09-06-18</I> - <B>Gotcha. Porter load, right.</B><xxx>

<BR>Carole ambushes me with a snap. Our porters carry their loads in these blue
bags with a blanket wrapped round shoulders and forehead while they cling to
the straps. They don't have the full backpacks used by more affluent
outfitters, such as The Gap.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-210.jpeg">
<I>D226-210 09-06-18</I> - <B>M. ac-cumulus-ating Inca wisdom.</B><xxx>

<BR>Cumuli rise in the background. We stroll around grooving on the ambiance of
the site. Only we seniors know what it is to "groove" on anything.
<BR><P><B>June 18 Day 1, pm.</B>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-217.jpeg">
<I>D226-217 09-06-18</I> - <B>Upwarder and onwarder.</B><xxx>

<BR>After lunch, more altitude to gain. Up through slopes of bromeliads and
grasses long gone into seasonal maturity.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-218.jpeg">
<I>D226-218 09-06-18</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>Crossing small bridges, over rivulets feeding eventually into the Urubamba
River.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-219.jpeg">
<I>D226-219 09-06-18</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>We seem to be leaving the last villages behind. You can see a hydro tower in
the valley. Perhaps an Inca ruin at centre. The trail is so well used that
you're seldom out of sight of other hikers. 500 per day, we heard. Even so,
not so congested that we bump into each other.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-222.jpeg">
<I>D226-222 09-06-18</I> - <B>Still a few farms.</B><xxx>

<BR>Some agriculture even at this height. The cows look healthy though nibbling
on last year's grass. The hills appear to have contour lines. Probably animal
tracks. Centuries of foraging have produced a kind of miniature terracing
effect.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-223.jpeg">
<I>D226-223 09-06-18</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>We're moving briskly along now, but still outpaced by the porters. The
surrounding mountains are visible in full magnificence. A typical trail
section here of beaten gravel. Few stairs, no clambering, but a steady
ascent.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-223A.jpeg">
<I>D226-223A V11-10-10</I> - <B>On the trail FX</B><xxx>

<BR>Here's my first example of what I call the photo-sketch technique. It's done
in the studio after the foot slogging is over with. Not always easy to
predict what might make a good p-s picture. I try to document the trip,
first of all. That means taking a lot of contextual pictures, not only
stunning views. But the best photos frequently make the best photo sketches.
<P>The "scenic" approach to scenery?</B>
In the studio I usually test a picture by printing it 11x17 and standing it
scenically with others on the mantelpiece. For artistic purposes the "good"
pictures are the ones that are intelligible and interesting from across the
room. What is this "across the room" quality? To my eye, it consists of a
recognisable and iconic structure, and often a kind of thematic quality.
<P>How about: Figures in a landscape?</B>
It doesn't have to be titled this way. But it helps me to imagine that a
picture could have some such wider association. Having some inkling of a
picture's thematic agenda could also help in the evaluation of the different

<I>D226-224 09-06-18</I> - <B>Terraced Inca site.</B><xxx>

<BR>We begin to pass stupendous Inca sites like this one. The upper buildings
comprised storehouses and accommodation for workers and guard people. The
scalloped edges below apparently had some significance in Inca iconography.
Possibly to represent the coils of a serpent. The raised terrace would also
be above rainy season flood levels.

<BR>This illustrates a pitfall of using digital techniques to do what is very
close to what the sketcher or watercolourist often does. The tools here
emphasise edges. Natural scenes frequently have plenty of broken rock and
foliage and the challenge is to restrain the effects to essential details.
Otherwise the picture takes on the cluttered quality of an overworked sketch.

<BR>A bit of a shocker beside the trail:  A hiker from another group points

<BR>Lunch time. A light meal of sandwiches and cool drinks on improvised picnic
table and benches. Every so often you encounter patches of substantial
vegetation like these trees, where the configuration of the land convinces
rainclouds to part with some of their moisture. Those are bromeliads on the
branches. Their reddish spikey leaves are not part of the tree.

<BR>Along the way we pass this view of the campsite we've just left behind. At
first I think this looks like some local version of Nazca lines. But the
"V"-shaped features are drainage channels between tenting areas. The idea is
to make sure that water from the hillside above drains away from the tents and
into the little creek at the bottom.

The ability to see far ahead and to anticipate a route. It's not an ordinary

visualize it, but the place still emanates some of the power it might have
had to the ancients. We walk round the ruin, full of corridors, unexpected

<BR>Here the details of foliage are reduced to Turner-esque glints of sunlight on
the leaves. The finer detail of the distant mountains has been blended with a
wet-on-wet process, but the outlines are preserved even in the clouds. These
have an agressive quality that harmonizes with a kind of "hob-knobbing with
the elements" idea.
<P>Real figures, iconic landscape</B>
The original details of the figures have been allowed to show through. The
digital process is highly composite. You can combine various steps of
abstraction and interpretation with the original image, and apply the result
to local areas of the image. Thus, the clouds are softly blended within but
outlined along the edges.

everywhere.

<BR>This comes close to abstract, but for me, the effect works because it uses
less information to evoke the same or even an enhanced idea of the original

<BR>The morning of our last day we're wakened at 4:30am. We stumble around the
crowded campground in the dark, looking for washrooms and breakfast. Then we
head for the exit where we stand in line in the dark with headlamps glowing.
There we wait at a closed gate monitored by a parks official till we can be
released to stampede down the trail toward Machu Picchu.
<BR> This formality is to prevent people from attacking the trail too early and
either falling off a cliff in the near total darkness, or arriving at the
site before opening time. Or, perhaps, they want us to get there at just the
right psychological moment. Nobody seems to know exactly what's going on.

<BR>The site was probably covered at the time of discovery by the kind of brush

<BR>Angelo explains how they split the rock without the equipment we take for
granted today. Locating the cleavage planes, holes were chiselled and wooden
wedges inserted. These, when wetted, would then crack the rock along the
cleavage plane. So if you knew and respected the nature of the rock, you could
accomplish what would otherwise take an awful lot of brute force hacking.

the ancient Incas.

that they found the site "sterile". It does have an almost too-well
manicured look, especially when you compare it to the mess that appears in
some of Hiram Bingham's pictures.
<BR>  Fresh from the relative isolation of the trail we find it has an almost
uncanny "recently deserted" quality. Like some town that has been abandoned
with very little sign of damage to explain the desertion.

<BR>Finally, we decide that it's time for a rest and head to the site's bus stop
and a ride down into the town. We didn't even consider walking down. Too

little silty. But without wanting to diminish Peruvian hospitality, I have to
admit that the water was much hotter in Ecuador at Papallacta. Q.V.

<BR>See those 5 small stones embedded in the rock wall? Steps to permit Inca
workers to get from one terrace level to the next. We've used similar steps
in other parts of the site. This detail brings home our common mentality.
I've just made a resolution to never again bad-mouth the "stone age". As if
this was a period full of flintstone-like, knuckle-dragging primitives.

scalloped edges in some of the agricultural terraces we saw a few days ago.

<BR>These walls look almost too fresh and new to have survived from the 16th

with loving care. It looks almost like a contemporary building project in
progress, waiting for the roofs and interiors to be finished.

<I>D226-540 09-06-22</I> - <B>Do I see an echo?</B><xxx>

<BR>Several stones like this on the site, reflecting nearby mountain profiles.
The Incas not only coped with their environment, they seemed to worship the
mountains. Something in common with a few people today, I'll hazard.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-542.jpeg">

<I>D226-543 09-06-22</I> - <B>Serious stone-masonry.</B><xxx>

<BR>A fine example of Inca masonry. Hard to fit a knife blade between many of
these stones. How did the Incas do this? I don't think I've heard a definitive
answer. Probably not just a genius for predicting how a stone would fit, then
somehow carving it ahead of time, and having it miraculously TURN OUT to fit.
I suspect they had a practical trial-and-error method. ...
<BR> For instance: trying the fit, seeing the discrepancy, removing the stone,
taking material off to improve the fit, repeating this to get as close as
desired. In addition, the stones could be roughly dished where they meet. If
one face was dished more than its corresonding face, then the stones would
meet only along a narrower outer edge. This could then be speedily trimmed
from the outside without repeatedly removing the stone from its position.

<I>D226-548 09-06-22</I> - <B>A gnomon and calendar stone.</B><xxx>

either with points of the Inca compass, dates in their calendar, or with other
locations within view on the horizon.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-549.jpeg">
<I>D226-549 09-06-22</I> - <B>Feel the power?</B><xxx>

<BR>Hard to get near the stone, particularly with that tape round the edge to
keep us from putting paws on it. An enterprising guide is trying to suggest
to this young group that it may radiate a mysterious force. He has everybody
close their eyes and hold out palms to feel for the emanations emitted by
this rock of power.

<I>D226-549A V10-07-12</I> - <B>Feel the power? FX</B><xxx>

<BR>The faces have been allowed to show through the outline effect. The picture
is also brighter, contrastier and sharper than the original. But it dispenses
with a small amount of (hopefully irrelevant) detail. Generally, the outline
effect lends itself more easily to subjects or artifacts that have close to
regular shapes, such as, architecture, masonry, horizons, clothing.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA/D226/D226-552.jpeg">
<I>D226-552 09-06-22</I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>I don't feel any emanations, but certainly do feel the significance of the
thing. It's a focal point of such a vast sytem of terraces and buildings, of
a trail traversed for hundreds of years by runners, porters and pilgrims up
to the present day. It would be hard NOT to be focussed on this object, even
if you don't know its exact cultural significance

<I>D226-553 09-06-22</I> - <B>Slightly tapered window treatments.</B><xxx>

<BR>On the high altar platform, Merle is standing in front of a typical Inca
window. We're not quite sure if this taper was a purely aesthetic preference
or a structural issue. The lintel stone could be smaller than with a purely
rectangular window, and the form would approach a little closer to the ideal
of an arch.

<I>D226-556 09-06-22</I> - <B>House walls repeat mountain profile.</B><xxx>

<BR>Do these house walls look like the mountain profiles behind them? The Inca
house-building technique was probably governed by the contruction materials
at hand. Yet there's a certain consistency that could have reinforced the
self-image of the inhabitants as a mountain people.

possibilities. But the original image of the girl, cute and vulnerable, has
been allowed to show through, and is less hard-edged than the surrounding

<I>D226-572 09-06-22</I> - <B>With a good view.</B><xxx>

<BR>A perfect view. Time to sit down and put it all together. Say, I can see a huge
line-up on one of the inner walls of the courtyard. Looks like a major tourist
group has arrived. To the left centre you can see a quarry area with tumbled
pieces of large stone. This served the site as a sources of building
material.

<I>D226-572A V10-07-12</I> - <B>A room with a view. FX</B><xxx>

<BR>The effect here is subtle. You might not even guess that the original photo
has been adjusted. The local contrast has increased and the structure of the
image is, to me, clearer because of the small enhancement of the outlining.
plus the slight watercolour-ish blending and brightening of the colour areas
within the outlines.

immaculate white gloves. I could picture the wearer of that garden-party hat

<BR>We arrive at a location opposite the back of the Museum of Natural History.
This is housed in what was a church built atop the Inca Temple of the Sun.
The crowds are dense. Some have wangled themselves balcony seats.

<BR>Something iconic about this tableau: civil servants, mandarins, chamberlains
bowing and scraping. In the ante-rooms of power, but making all the real
decisions. Second from the left, he has an especially cunning look.
Something like Sir Humphrey in the Britcom "Yes, Minister."

<I>D227-253 09-06-24</I> - <B>Himself.</B><xxx>

<BR>The Inca himself appears. An arresting figure. Our guide says that the role
is assigned to an actor who has dark skin, a big nose, a booming voice and
who is fluent in Quechua, the language of the Incas and rural Peru.

<BR>We change location to the Plaza d'Armas nearby. Here the festivities take on
a processional character. Inca style music maintains a steady, heart-pounding
thump-thump. Interrupted sometimes by glitches in the sound system.

folkloric pageant. The statue of J.C. was donated by Palestinian Christians.

<BR>Notes: {hist}
<BR> 09-10-03: This created for possible synchro sound slide show.
<BR> 09-10-26: sound clips recorded for Galapagos. Earlier, recorded Inca Trail.
Not entirely happy with the result. Delivery is clunky, "um"-y in the parts
recorded extemp. Seems that only a fully scripted reading sounds smooth and
natural. Another prob. Too long, too much detail that only Derek is
interested in? Could fix on two options. Reduce the "selected" pictures,
"#", in number. Let the "all" selection be for personal delectation. This
will work for selections in the shows folders. They should already have been
culled from the "select" pictures at the camera card level.
<BR> There are, in effect, at least 3 categories of pictures for slide shows:
<BR> 1. pictures marked "select" ("{#}"). S.b. only those of the most general level
of interest.
<BR> 2. pictures unmarked  ("/gra"). Includes the above, plus personal choices,
"artistic" potential, etc.
<BR> 3. all pictures (also "/gra"). All pictures, including the original camera
card portfolios, duplicates, insurance shots, variations, mistakes.
<BR> No way to separately designate 2. and 3. by means of some specific text
marker on the tag. So, must simply eliminate the 3. tags from the slide show
file. They continue to exist for detailed review or retrieval in the original
camera card .PTF.
<BR> 09-12-08: Gallery. Images selected from the Inca Trail series
as potential wall pictures. Print proofs to evaluate. Exit here
if you are viewing for the travel experience only.

<BR> 09-12-19: Portals in day 5 and Sacred Valley. Also, Sacred Valley supports
the idea of "ruins in a landscape". Only here and in Greece can I recall
having seen so many sites that conjure up that theme. How to define the
idea so that DRAMATIC landscapes are featured? Mountains, shorelines.
<BR> 10-03-19: Inca Trail show to BURA group, March 17. Used 2SHOW.SCR
procedure, allows speaker to view notes while audience sees only slides and
captions on projector or outboard monitor. Worked reliably. Ending, perhaps
weak. For short show, should jump to end of Aguas Calienties and trains.
Would provide a better sense of closure.

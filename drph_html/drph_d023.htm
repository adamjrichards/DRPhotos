<BR>These were taken with an Olympus D-40 digital
camera on a miniature tripod. Activated by the camera's remote
control device.
<BR>Complications: The camera must be "on" all the time for the
remote control to work. This rapidly uses up the battery. I took
about 30 minutes to get these pictures. Then the camera shut
itself down. An outboard 3 volt power supply would help.
<BR>The effective range of the remote control is about 5 feet. And
it has to be aimed from the front of the camera, so the lens
has to be pointing towards you. This means you have to sit
close to the subject and wait very, very quietly.

<BR>Hard to get down a narrow crack when your cheeks are bulging
with seeds.

<BR>The chipmunk noticed and investigated the camera.

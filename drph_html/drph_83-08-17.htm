<P>In Search of James Fielding
<P>In 1816, an unlikely expedition led by Captain Jonah Ames, R.N.,
explored the future boundary area of British North America,
moving west from the Red River along the 49th parallel to the
Rockies and beyond. This is the record of a 1983 motor trip
which followed the track of that expedition. 
<P>
<P><U>August 17 - Wednesday</U>
<P>   Odometer: 132776
<P>   Departed: 10:21 from St. Catharines
<P>   Arrived : 19:46 at Chutes P.P., Ontario
<P>             St. Catharines to Tobermory in 4:33 hrs
<P>
<P>   A fine beginning.  We park the car and dawdle in the gift
shops of Tobermory, nearly losing our place in line for the
ferry.  We sprint the last hundred yards and roar on board the
Chi-Chi-Maun, Big Fire Canoe. The deckhands divert us up some
impossible gangway leading to the ceiling of the hold. The hood
of the car points at a maze of pipes and wires in the roof; I
can't see if I'm driving into the car ahead of me. A hydraulic
mechanism hoists the whole gangway into the air with us and the
car on it.  We make our escape to the upper decks.
<P>        The weather is cold and foggy; we huddle in the lounge
on the way across eating sandwiches, and drinking coffee; we
compare the service to the B.C. ferry system (favourably) and
discuss personal origins (mine - unfavourably). Egotistical, but
appropriate, since James Fielding is a creature of MY ego and we
are supposed to be tracinging HIS origins.  Or is it OUR
origins, and that raises the question of whether every journey
eventually becomes an inner journey. At this point, my alter ego
and I are still not completely convinced we will succeed in
reaching our destination, the distances are so great. He faces
months of canoeing and riding; I face the miles behind the wheel
of an ageing station wagon. At times, I wonder if Fielding and
his friends have begun to take on a life of their own, luring
their creator to his ruin. And then we enter harbour at South
Baymouth and all the passengers make a rush for their cars. 
<P>        At one leap, we have taken off from Upper Canada and
landed on the frontier.  Driving north across the island, we
reach the sheltered North Channel, the old canoe route running
east and west between the mainland and Manitoulin Island.
Immediately following the war, in 1815 and after, the North
Channel was the subject of intensive marine surveys by Owen,
Bayfield and others.  To the young Fielding, these men were
heroes, braving the elements to produce reliable charts and
shoreline sketches. They mapped a route that extended from the
mouth of the French River to the Falls of St. Mary's, present
day Sault Ste. Marie. 
<P>        We camp at Chutes Provincial Park.
<P>
<P>
<P>August 18 - Thursday
<P>
<P>Odometer: 133090
Departed: 7:40
Arrived : 19:20 at Sibley P.P., Ont.
<P>
<P>        We spend the day making milage past Sault Ste. Marie and
along the north shore of Lake Superior.  We pause in Marathon
to replenish fuel and groceries and to recall our hike on the
Pukasaw Trail in 1981.  On that trip, we discovered the scene
of the confrontation between James, Mrs Maidstone and
Mr Maidstone which resulted in James having to remove a ball
from Maidstone's shoulder by the light of a campfire.
<P>        The road to the north of Lake Superior is a driver's
dream. But you need quick reflexes and a sharp eye for scenic
stopping places, or you won't get any pictures. You are
relentlessly pursued by leadfooted drivers who will stop at
nothing to pass in the teeth of oncoming traffic. There is
frequently a real problem of how to pull over safely or to cross
to a parking area on the opposite side of the highway without
risking an accident. 
<P>        The park at Sibley is 30 kilometres from Hwy 17 and
down a winding sideroad.  We have a swim after supper at dusk.
There is a fine, sandy beach and the water is warm and clear.
Heavy rain and an electrical storm liven up the night.  We are
beginning to notice things forgotten in the rush to get away:
matches, can and bottle openers, pocket knife.
<P>
<P>
<P>August 19 - Friday
<P>
<P>Odometer: 133656
Departed: 8:45
Arrived : 19:30  at Rushing River P.P., Ont.
<P>          Add 1 hour to elapsed time for crossing time zone.
<P>
<P>        Before leaving Sibley, we drive to the end of the
peninsula.  There is a historic site opposite Silver Island,
something about a silver mine, which makes sense.  But the
fog is thick and time is short so we decide against a hike to
Thunder Cape and the Sleeping Giant. It was while rounding this
cape that Mrs Maidstone and James said what they though were
their final goodbyes.  It was here that she gave him that
handkerchief embroidered with a red rose which was to have such
fatal consequences in the months ahead.

<P>        In Thunder Bay we seek out Old Fort William.  The
recreation is elaborate and well done; the period represented
is exactly coincident with the date the Ames Expedition would
have passed through (c1816, just before the unpleasantness with
Lord Selkirk). Staff people are got up in costume to represent
individuals of the period.  I talk to "Mr. McGillveray" in
the Great Hall about the fortunes of the fur trade; I hobnob
with armourers and canoe-makers. Outside, along the waterfront,
is a voyageur encampment with a schooner tied up at the
quayside. We watch "Simon Fraser" depart from the dock amid the
firing of cannons to be paddled in state down the river. Off
to the side of the fort, we inspect an Indian camp with
demonstrations of crafts and cooking. 
<P>        We stay from 10:30 in the morning to 2:30 in the
afternoon, about 4 hours before we came to our senses again in
the twentieth century. It takes this long to do the displays
justice.  A boat trip leaves from the river bank, and if you
take this as well as seeing all the buildings in the fort, the
visit will become an all day excursion. 
<P>        The present day recreated site is far upriver from the
original location of the fort, and so it was impossible to tell
if Cape Thunder or the Sleeping Giant might have been visible
from the original dock.  I am making a mental note to check the
waterfront area downtown on the way back home.

<P>        We visit Kakabeka Falls before leaving the Lakehead
and watch a wedding party in their finery being photographed
at the viewing platform overlooking the falls.  The
bridemaids' flowers are plastic, the better to resist the
ravages of time.
<P>
<P>
<P>August 20 - Saturday
<P>
<P>Odometer: 134017
Departed: 8:25
Arrived : 18:30 at Turtle Mountain P.P., Manitoba
<P>
<P>        Entering Manitoba, the transition between woods and
grasslands is a genuine surprise to the Ontario resident.   We
are driving through forested country; then, at one point, I
look down to study the map; when I look up again, the land
is level to the horizon, dotted only with clusters of aspen
surrounding the farmsteads. 
<P>        We skirt Winnipeg, towering in the distance, via a
network of convenient bypass roads. The site where the Ames
Expedition camped, on the west bank, near Fort Douglas and the
junction on the Assiniboine, is buried deep under urban
renewal. 
<P>        We head down the Red River. There is a margin of trees
along its bank, with willows common, today a dark, wet green,
contrasting with the harvested grain fields. We cross over to
the east bank: stubble to the horizon, a thin line of distant
trees, drizzle and grey overcast.  A few fields of sunflowers
impersonate the proverbial huddled masses; their yellow petals
are fallen; they stand shoulder to shoulder, eyeless faces all
staring after some invisible leader. 
<P>        We stop by the Red River to reconnoitre those scenes
where Fielding and Harris followed the track of Mr. Maidstone.
Crossing a harvested field for a better look at the river, I
discover the incredible black soil caking onto my sandals to
form a pair of overshoes made of thick mud. This is the same
soil the fur traders swore up and down was no good for
agriculture.  On the river bank, is a vine with pointed leaves
and bunches of pink flowerlets on a stem.  I am sure that
somewhere James Fielding made a note of it in his diary for
later identification.  In 1816, he was a better botanist than I,
in 1984, with all the resources of "A Field Guide to
Wildflowers" at my disposal.  A few drops of rain plop into the
water. 
<P>        Passing through Pembina on the U.S. border, we inspect
the junction of the Pembina River and the Red.  The muddy banks
are backed up with modern levees to restrain the floodwaters.
There is a half-hearted historical display and a log house in
the park at the forks. The setting is nondescript but it is
almost uncanny how the terrain and the weather are exactly as I
had imagined. Fielding and Harris would have ridden along behind
a screen of riverbank trees, attempting to keep an eye on
Maidstone.   They would have been compelled to ford a river that
was higher in June than in August, but the same muddy banks and
murky water that disgusted the fastidious Harris are visible
today.  I feel close to my characters in this place.  We drive
west to where the banks of the Pembina, not much more than a
pastoral stream in its upper reaches, would have provided that
meadow where Col. Enright made his camp. There he laid his plans
with Maidstone and waited for the advantageous moment to move
out across the prairie to intercept the track of Captain Ames's
party, soon to depart from the vicinity of Fort Douglas. 
<P>        We turn north and re-enter Manitoba, crossing the
upper tributaries of the Assiniboine River system.  Here are
those wide, smiling valleys beloved of the Metis buffalo
hunters. It was somewhere near this point, or a little to the
southwest, that Fielding and Harris had their brush with the
Sioux and where they witnessed that skirmish which led to the
death of Maidstone.

<P>        We reach Turtle Mountain Park and make camp.  The
Turtle Mountains are an islolated area of hills and lakes in the
south-west corner of Manitoba, near the U.S. border.  The many
ponds have a numerous population of turtles and this is how the
region got its name. At one time, the area supported a haying
industry on the rich meadows within the forest. 
<P>        The park does not have many patrons this season and we
have a wide choice of campsites. Smearing ourselves generously
with insect repellent, we walk along an excercise trail and end
up at a marshy lake where there is a dammed-up section for
swimming, a playground and a change room. It cloudy and cool
and we nearly freeze while swimming.
<P>
<P>
<P>August 21 - Sunday
<P>
<P>Odometer: 134411
Departed: 8:25
Arrived : 21:00 at Lewis and Clark State Park, North Dakota
<P>
<P>        We leave Turtle Mountain park and vist the
International Peace Garden straddling the border. It is filled
with scenic drives, spacious gardens and has a soaring monument
in the centre which has, for me, strange echoes of Vimy Ridge.
We drive a long way in and then a long way out again. 
<P>
<P>        The grand old Duke of York,
<P>        He had ten thousand men.
<P>        He marched them up to the top of the hill,
<P>        And he marched them down again.
<P>
<P>        What IS the real purpose of this place?  There seems to
be nothing to "do" here. It lies on a road between Outer
Manitoba and Inner North Dakota which must see very little
except local traffic. You would think the people who live nearby
would have more practical things on their minds. Perhaps
tourists go out of their way to come here. If so, there must be
something everybody knows but me.   The main reason we stopped
in the neighbourhood was to camp in the provincial park next
door and to view the Turtle Hills themselves. 
<P>        Perhaps this park is the "floral clock" of Manitoba.
Every day, in the tourist season near Niagara Falls, you see
tour buses and crowds congregating at the floral clock on the
Niagara Parkway. In the throng are quite a few foreigners. But
you might wonder why someone would come all the way from
Yokahama to make a point of posing his family in front of a
raised flower bed laid out in the shape of a clock face.
Somehow, certain items on the tourist itinerary become
"hardwired" into the guidebook program; no one knows why they
are there any more, but you are not allowed to push the "stop"
button till you have completed the entire list.
<P>        Speaking of practical matters: it is Sunday; we have to
cross the border; the local gas station is closed and we are
nearly empty.  The range of our behemoth station wagon, even at
a modest cruising speed, leaves much to be desired.   I estimate
it will do about 320 miles on a tankful, but this is not quite
far-ranging enough for touring off the arterial roads,
especially if you allow for going short early on Sunday
mornings.  Nevertheless, we press on across the border and
soon find gasoline on the other side of the hills in ___ N.D.
<P>        The turtle Hills extend over the border. Going south,
you find yourself on a height of land overlooking the approaches
to the Missouri country.   When you go down on the plains and
look back, you can still glimpse that blue ridge of wet hills in
the north which heralds the 49th parallel.  In historical times,
this was recognised as the threshold of British North America.
A subtle transition nudges you into a sense of anticipation:
colours are now beginning to shift from blue-green to brown,
but it is still not clear what changes in the landscape are in
store for the south-bound traveller.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0219/0219-26.jpeg">
0219-26 83-08-17 - In the Turtle Hills.</P>

<P>        In ___ there is a marvelous junk sculpture of automobile
wheel rims welded into the shape of a turtle.  The head looks
back at the Turtle Hills, bobbing contentedly to the whirr of
intestinal machinery.
<P>        We reach the valley of the Missouri.  But before we can see
the river itself, there is a subtle impression of greater
visibility to the south, of the land sloping down to some basin
below the line of sight. Then we see the lake formed by the
Garrison Dam.  We drive alongside and continue on its left bank
below the dam to ---[?]. There we cross the Missouri and drive
north up the opposite side. Above the dam, the terrain doesn't
look as you expect since Lake Sakakawea innundates the valley up
to the level of the surrounding tableland.   But now, down below
us, is the familiar valley of celebrated by balladeers and
story-tellers: majestic bluffs on either side, rich bottom land,
a massive flow of water between banks lined with cottonwood and
willow.

<P>        We continue northwest looking for the turnoff to the
site of the Mandan village.  On the left is a rolling bluff
carpeted dry prairie grass.  We turn at a modest signpost and
reach an ordinary-looking bit of pasturage on the old river
bank. Beside the entrance to the property, is a mobile home
which is the headquarters of the attendant.  We drive along a
track through the grass and come to the edge of the bank where
we park at an interpretive booth.  There appears to be very
little to see. We inspect a map on which circles are marked
representing the remains of Mandan lodges.

<P>        I stroll to the bank of the river.  The relentless flood
that should have passed this point has long receded.  Today the
actual riverbank is a half mile distant; below me is a boggy
mass of reeds and a few sluggish streams.  The Missouri lies
hidden beyond a line of distant cottonwoods.
<P>        I look for recognisable features. The bank comes to a
point, jutting out over the damp thickets below. I scramble down
into the underbrush and struggle out into the open to where I
can see the bank in profile.  I try to imagine the underbrush
stripped away, the Missouri rolling past the high bluff where I
stood a moment before.

0220-15 83-08-17 - Contrast a Sioux teepee.</P>

<P>        There is a certain painting, done by Bodmer I think.
Two Mandan women are launching a skin boat immediately below a
steep promontory.  At the top is a palisade with glimpses of
domed earth lodges.  It is then I hear the whispering of the
ghosts of a past which I have spent so long recreating in my own
imagination. I visualize the sweat lodge on the shore, hear the
sounds of a numerous population above.
<P>        I press through the reeds and struggle back up the bank,
up a certain cleft in the old shoreline which seems inexplicably
familiar.  On an open field where the grass has been mowed we
see the circular depressions of vanished lodges.  It was on the
roofs of these vanished lodges that the visiting white men sat
on the first day of their visit as they looked out over the
village, meditating the amazing scene about them.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0220/0220-17.jpeg">

<P>        In the centre of the cluster of circular depressions is
an open space; near its edge is one circle, perhaps a little
larger than the others. So it was here, I imagine, that James
Fielding witnessed the initiation rituals of the Okipa.  In this
circle where I now stand, the youths were hoisted skyward by the
pierced flesh of their pectoral muscles.

<P> And beyond the expanse
of grass, past a long ditch that must once have been the village
palisade and moat, lie the bluffs. From somewhere up there in
the territory of the buffalo, Lone Man would have appeared to
make his way down to the village at the start of the Okipa.
<P>        And somewhere out there, James Fielding crouched low in
the grasses, searching for the Medicine Man's son after the
torture of the youths was over.  There is a patch of tres that
might once have been a slough. It might have been there that he
located the exhausted boy and protected him from those who
threatened harm.
<P>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0220/0220-05.jpeg">
0220-05 83-08-17 - Only a few pathetic remains.</P>

<P>        We examine the ground. Here and there are small piles of
bleached bones, whether gathered by treasure-hunters, rodents or
archaeologists we cannot tell; the soil is rich with fragments
of white, the substance of generations of animals and men - the
knuckle bones of those forgotten ancestors of men who have left
no descendants.  The raised burial platforms of the Indians are
gone; the Mandans are gone, exterminated by disease, their last
tribal lands innundated under the headpond of the Garrison dam.
<P>        We chat with the young man who maintains the site. He
provides useful bibliographical references and the suggestion
that we visit other sites in the vicinity.  Further north along
the riverbank, at Cut Knife Creek, is the site of a Hidatsa
village, another tribe of the region, also dwelling in earth
lodges. Here there is an interpretive centre and an earth lodge
recreated to scale. In the yard of the interpretive centre,
members of the buckskin fraternity demonstrate the frontier
crafts of leather tanning, black powder shootin' while dressed
in period costume.

badlands on the north shore of Lake Sakakawea.
<P>
<P>        Our way back north toward British territory leads over
the Garrison Dam to Route 1804, the Lewis and Clark Route along
the north side of Lake Sakakawea. Soon, we have views of the
badlands on those streams that feed the Missouri from the north;
we photograph picturesque vistas across the lake.  This lake did
not exist in historical times; it is entirely a creation of the
Garrison Dam.  The typical prospect in those days would have
been a wide valley with high bluffs; down the centre the river
once flowed, rolling past groves of willow. In the far distance,
to the south and southwest, we see a few of those flat-topped
buttes which give such a characteristic profile to wild-west
horizons.

<P>        Arriving at Lewis and Clark State Park near dusk, we
are unable to decipher the complex instructions at the
self-service entrance, and in desperation, we move right in and
made ourselves at home.  Eventually a ranger comes to collect
the fee and sell firewood.  The park also seems to be a centre
for boating on Lake Sakakawea.  We hear the sounds of revelry in
a small craft anchored off shore.  It is not a native craft,
Merle reminds me, harkening back to an inadvertant pun which I
may never live down.
<P>        A full moon hangs over the badlands on the opposite
shore; we make our fire on the ground, cowboy style, in a
circular firepit. This is one of the few places that does not
have the elaborate and self-consciously rustic fireplaces
usually favoured in woodland campsites. 
<P>        Today we have made a definite transition, and I suspect
that Fielding, Harris and the others would have sensed the same
thing on their way past this point in 1816.  You do get an
impression of "the plains" as soon as you leave behind the
forests of the Laurential Shield in eastern Manitoba, but you
have to come this far to encounter that peculiarly "western"
combination of dryland prairie, badlands and rolling plains.
Farms become ranches; green pastures and cultivated fields merge
into rangeland; valleys become gulleys. It is the edge of a new
kind of landscape extending all the way south to the cactus
country and beyond into Mexico.

<P>        Today we leave the Missouri, driving north through
Williston and Plentywood and up Big Muddy Creek.  This was the
route of the Ames Expedition as they made their way toward the
height of land between the Missouri and the South Saskatchewan
Rivers.  The valley floor is wide and level; there would have
been sufficient water and pasturage for horses.  On either side,
we see the eroded bluffs mentioned in the expedition's log.  At
the entrance to one of those valleys, over on the right, lies
the spot where James Fielding found signs of Colonel Enright's
passage and made the gruesome discovery of a victim of frontier
"justice". 
<P>        Just north of the 49th parallel, we turn west through
the wheat farms.  Finding water would have been the main problem
for an overland trek along the border. Although there is some
drainage going south to the Missouri, the creeks at their
headwaters are sluggish, particularly in high summer. A
westering party of horsemen might have to carry sufficient
drinking water for several days. But, at least, the badlands are
not extensive enough to present any serious obstacle to
movement.  Our chosen road climbs a succession of ridges
separating the basin of one stream from another and then drops
down again into the next valley, revealing long views of wheat
fields mixed with rangeland in the rougher areas. To the south,
across the width of a single farm, lies the international
border. 
<P>        It rains in the early afternoon and we have lunch at the
side of the road, dining on our usual picnic of sliced meat,
lettuce, tomatoes and chunks of cheese.   Merle says it makes
her feel deliciously guilty for not stopping to prepare a
"proper" meal. And all the while, I thought we WERE eating
proper meals. 
<P>
<P>        The Cyress Hills are a forested area straddling the
Saskatchewan-Alberta border and lie some ___ miles north of the
49th parallel.  An overland exploring party moving west would
have stopped here to hunt, to find good water and pasturage, and
to overlook the surrounding plains. The Ames Expedition had the
special task of evaluating the military potential of any
prominent natural features. These hills would have played an
important role as a staging point or a secure rallying place in
the advent of further hostilities with the Americans.  Whoever
controlled these hills would probably also control the South
Saskatchewan River.  But there was another over-riding reason
for being there:  the Enright Overland Expedition was also
in the area and preparing to enter Blackfoot country. The
Colonel had ventured considerably above the 49th parallel, to
sniff out the territory north of the Missouri basin in the
interests of an ambitious Jeffersonian continentalism.
<P>        Neither group, as yet, had any reason to regard the 49th
parallel as a forgone conclusion.  You may recall that the Ames
Expedition was none too reticent about crossing the line in the
opposite direction, in order to visit the Mandan villages, and
these were situated on the banks of the Missouri itself.  From
the British point of view, the American Louisiana Purchase
comprised the basin of the Mississippi River, excluding the
Missouri. [Check this.] This piece of wishful thinking, if
successful, would have eventually made the Missouri country, as
well as the entire Pacific Northwest, a British possession.
However, to claim a territory on the basis of obscure legality
and fuzzy geography is one thing, to possess it another.  This
was a point well-under stood by the elder Captain Fielding and
the astute Admiral Fisher.  To possess a territory you must, at
the very least, enter it, traverse it, drive your tent pegs
into its soil.

<P>        We make camp in Cypress Hills Provincial Park,
Saskatchewan, and that evening set out to explore. At dusk, from
a lookout on a high mound, we see orange light outlining
badlands and hills far away to the west and north.  The hill we
stand on is built entirely of pebbles and, in fact, the entire
range consists of an enormous gravel deposit laid down in
glacial times.

<P>This is one of the few times in my life that I've actually enjoyed (not just

<P>        Inching along the dusty back roads in the dark, we
encounter our first "texas gate" - a sort of cattle barrier in
the road, a culvert bridged over with spaced iron pipes. A car
can be driven slowly across this contraption, but cattle avoid
it for fear of putting their feet down the slots.
<P>        Our headlights pick out a sign showing access to the
back road to Fort Walsh; the road is described as dangerous,
passable only in good weather; we are intrigued. Can this aging
station wagon aspire to high adventure and find a new life for
itself as a Land-Rover?   That night, to be sure of an early
start, we fill up with gas at a station in the park and are
informed by the attendant, "Some guys I knew went in there once
(KNEW, past tense, ominous pause). Yup.  Had to haul 'em out
with a four-wheel drive - broken axle (sigh). Need yer oil
checked?"

<P>For me, walking through this environment is something like the experience
I've gotten on top of high mountains. One's immediate surroundings come to
stand for a wider reality. A Travellers on the Path of Life, sort of a thing.
I've heard it argued somewhere that parkland itself is coded into human
perception, perhaps from our early days in East Africa. Broad, open, rolling
spaces, punctated by patches of woodland, threaded by lakes and rivers,
roamed by animals. People were asked what sort of landscape they preferred:
desert, shoreline, mountains, flat plains, ice and snow. Many apparently
showed a preference for just the sort of landscape we see today.

<P>        The road to hell is paved with good intentions. The road
to Fort Walsh is paved with little else, but it is well worth
the boneshaking ride. From the heights within the park boundary
we descend out of an early mist through ranchland which gives
the illusion of original prairie. We linger to ogle flowers and
stroll by the roadside.  A hawk on a fence post takes flight and
hovers over my scalp, trying to intimidate the intruder with its
piercing shriek.  In the dry grass underfoot, nestle cactus,
huge puffballs.  Cattle graze in the distance and we can almost
imagine they are buffalo. The sloughs are fringed with green
bushes, contrasting with the dry prairie and filled with reeds
and ducks. As the trail drops down from the eastern range of the
hills, we have another long view to the west and south-west. I
strain at the horizon for a glimpse of the distant peaks of the
Rocky Mountains. Not yet.

<P><P><B>Also in Cypress Hills?</B>
<P><B>Big Muddy R.</B>
<P>        We reach Fort Walsh without mishap to the car.  It lies in the
western range of the Cypress Hills and Parks Canada has done a
reconstruction of the old R.C.M.P. post on its origianl site.
The fort is a palisaded collection of whitewashed log buildings,
without too much in the way of furniture, but it is the natural
setting which is intoxicating. We take a shuttle bus to Farwell's
Post down the valley, a convincing recreation of a frontier
trading post, complete with tour guides dressed up in period
costume. The buildings and sheds look lived-in and are chock
full of supplies and authentic-looking personal bric-a-brac. I
am convinced that someone has been sleeping in that bed over by
the wall. The crumbs of a meal are still visible on the table.
<P>        Near this site, there was a massacre of Indians by white
riff-raff in the year ___.  We stroll over to the scene of the
murder.  I can hardly stop asking questions and we stay on
through the arrival and departure of several additional busloads
of tourists. 
<P>        We decide to walk back to the fort through the hills,
strolling along the bank of the stream that connects the two
locations.  It is a perfect day of deep blue sky and warm
breezes. The ground on the hillsides crackles underfoot; the
plants of the open range are low and adapted to living with
little water; I almost step on a ground-hugging cactus that
looks like a diminutive version of the prickly pear. Below the
hillside path, the river winds in and out of lush thickets of
willow.  On the opposite side of the valley, rise undulating
hills, one beyond the other, with open meadows of sun-baked
grass and patches of trees, inviting the hiker or the
trail-rider to explore.
<P>
<P>        To stay here for a few days, to savour every moment the
unfamiliar privilege of seeing freely in all directions, to
experience the joy of spying out at a glance the day's march to
the distant goal, lieing far ahead on the horizon. ... She
lingers behind on the trail, intent on a meadowlark singing in a
bush. There is no one else, nothing but the hillside, the
valley, space.  We are here, alone.  I spy a secret place miles
away; we are there, making camp for the thousandth time,
eternally the same, eternally new.  She is far back now; I see
her stopping to look for berries; I sit on the hillside by
myself to wait, but I am close beside her. 
<P>
<P>        Nearing the fort, we glimpse an animal hunting in the
thickets by the stream. It sees us and repeats its high-pitched
cry of yip-yip-yip-aroooo. 
<P>        In an overgrown meadow below the fort, we find an old
antler. Most likely, the remains of a deer shot by Subinspector
Steele, R.N.W.M.P. in 1879.  On the strength of my artistic
licence, and the heightened awareness brought on by scenic
intoxication, I feel confident in making a positive
identification. 
<P>        Driving west through the Cypress Hills, we reach the
highest point in the whole region.  We park the car and look
out on a stunning prospect over the plains to the north and
west, all the way to the South Saskatchewan River.  It is
the highest vantage point we have reached so far on the trip,
but still no sight of the Rockies. This leg of the Ames
Expedition's journey, dropping down out of the hills toward the
valley of the Saskatchewan, was the occasion of the death of the
interpreter Bonnechance. After this incident, the expedition
members looked toward the plains with increased trepidation,
knowing they had to traverse the whole territory of the
Blackfoot Nation.  We drive north-west to Medicine Hat, a far
less intimidating prospect. 
<P>        We keep a watch for the likely site of the expedition's
encounter with the Blood Indians. According to the record, the
incident took place some half-day's ride south of the river, in
a shallow ravine off a minor tributary of the South
Saskatchewan. Along the south side of the valley near Medicine
Hat, there is a bluff, something like the one along the Missouri
at the Mandan village. Driving southwest again from Medicine Hat
toward Lethbridge, the land rises gradually, but we crossed few
ravines that suggested that siege which consumed the bulk of the
expedition's black powder and nearly resulted in a massacre.
One may only hope that some local historian will have the
initiative to scout out the area until the exact location is
found. 
<P>        It rains in the late afternoon. We watch a column of
water falling out of a black cloud base, visible from a great
distance.  [Insert Fielding fragment re lightning strike.]
<P>        South of Lethbridge, the land continues flat until you
reach the foothills.  Again, as the vantage points get higher,
there are those splendid rolling vistas, culminating in Cardston
and the approaches to Waterton.  Here, at last, the mountains
leap from the plain into full view; we enter the portals of the
Rockies and are immediately surrounded by peaks.  In historical
times these were the Stoney Mountains.  Either name is
appropriate, impressions of rock and stone overwhelm us from
above, sharp-edged crags, swept bare of soil; to the easterner,
it is a new revelation of geology.  Remember, we have hardly
seen a stone bigger than your fist since the Ontario border and
even the badlands of the Missouri had more the character of
eroded earth. 
<P><B>Alberta Foothills.</B>
<P><B>Waterton, Alberta.</B>
<P>        We arrive late in Waterton but there are one or two campsites
left on an area of wet green lawn.  This is European style
camping with everyone packed close in together and the town
only a short walk outside the campground.

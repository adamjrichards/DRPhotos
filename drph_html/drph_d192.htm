<BR>These print with Windows viewer but get cropped if the aspect ratio isn't
13x18 when printed 2/page on 8.5x11. All deleted on <I></I>NED. Still on <I></I>FRED.
This was a test folder for printing only.
<BR> - sb. in folder n40, files renamed n40-013, etc.?
<BR> - how to cross-ref from this portfolio to camera .ptf?
<BR> - vice versa.
<BR> - prob. has to be by date.
<BR> - a/gra... option? date is 4th argument.
<BR> - starting from, eg. n40.ptf or d100.ptf, can't be sure of target .ptf or
exact date. Above, 06-04-18 may not coresspond to a particular image with
that date. Also, a particular image date may not correspond to an exact
diary date. How to link up file viewing at closest point with min.
keystrokes.
<BR> - can prob. assume, date, ph. title, transcribed to .ptf.
<BR> - a partial or approximate search capab. in edit. eg. given "06-04-18" to
find in a target file, could search for closest matching substring, eg.
"06-04". Then a manual hunt downward with <pgdn>. This could also work with
the portfolio list, which normally contains dates from the file headline.
<BR> - poss., a bmp.scr option to bring up the portfolio list, select a member,
read it, return to the calling portfolio.
<BR> - see also y2006.ptf for remarks on this subject.

<BR> These "photocopies" were taken with flash. Notebook angled away from camera
to prevent hotspot reflection. Very sharp because of fast exposure. Exposure
probably set by trial and error. Try to ensure that page background is close
to white, but not so white that the text and drawings are faded.

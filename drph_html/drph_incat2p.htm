<BR>Start the computer on the external screen or projector. Extend the desktop
onto the laptop screen. Execute the script 2show.scr. This will start up two
WWWB invocations, WWWB #1 and WWWB #2. Move the partial screen WWWB #1
invocation to the laptop screen. This will be the lecturer's primary screen
with notes and multiple pictures visible in 6-line mode. The external screen
will display only pictures and main captions in 1-line slide show mode. Make
sure the two screens remain synchronized at the same graphics tag. Use the
<pgdn> and <pgup> keys to advance, backup the slides. These keys are
programmed to search ahead or back for the selection marker "{#}" on the
graphics tag. Be careful of using other keys. Test out operation beforehand.
For instance, the <f2> key will scroll the lecturer's screen ahead to allow
reading notes longer than 6 lines. But be careful not to get the cursor ahead
of the next "{#}" marker since the <pgdn> function searches relative to the
current cursor position. Similarly for <pgup>.
<BR>   Operations can be terminated by repeatedly pressing the <esc> key on both
invocations. Also exit the "H"(Hotkey) icon on the status line.
<BR>   With the current 2-screen version, all the graphics tags and notes for the
slide show must be in the same .PTF (portfolio) file. This eliminates the
option to make jumps across portfolios that is available in fully automatic
slide shows. Movie clips are supported in the current 2-screen version.
Double-click on the movie clip tag and the display will be routed to the
external screen.

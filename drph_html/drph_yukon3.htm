<BR><B>July 27, Sunday.</B>   Merle and I walk up the hill to the car rental depot near
the airport and drive back down for lunch. We then head out of town to
Takhini Hot Springs to soak out the accumulated stiffness of our canoe trip.
In line for tickets with scads of Cherman Sprachers.

<BR>The air in the pool area is cool but the water pleasantly warm, even hot in
the inlet area. Distant snow clad peaks on the horizon, many kids playing. It
seems that the locals come here as well as the tourists. You can purchase a
season pass. Apparently the place is open in the winter. What fun, relaxing
after a heavy day of dog-team mushing, snow-machine repairs, or stoking the
boilers of abandoned steamboats on the marge of Lake Laberge. Miriam and
Adonis are catching a flight home this evening. But we still have two more
days for tourist reconaissance, options Kluane and Atlin.

<BR>On the way back to Whitehorse we detour to the shores of Lake Laberge.
Spectacular spot to camp. Plenty of open water and rocky shorelines to
explore. Might even be a good spot to have a sailboat. No steamboat wrecks
in sight.

<BR>In fine weather, the lake has none of the grim associations of "that night on
the marge of Lake Laberge, that I cremated Sam McGee." This is cottage
country for Whitehorse people. Located off the Alaska Highway, these views
are taken from a pleasant campsite near the shore.

<BR>Later that afternoon we explore Miles Canyon, upstream from the power

is not as deep as it used to be.

<BR>Powerboats come through the canyon full throttle. Nothing like the hazard to
navigation of the olden days, although of course, you can't get past the
power dam without a portage. So this is, in effect, the upper limit to
navigation on the Yukon River. Below this point, you could, I believe, drift,
paddle or motor all the way to the Bering Strait.

We continue north on the Alaska Highway to a point just past Haines Junction.
From this vicinity, enormous mountains are visible in the west. One peak,
standing above the others, is entirely covered in snow and ice. At a Parks
Canada World Heritage Site, we can't see the wonderful view because of the
shrubbery in our way. Do they have a fixation about not cutting trees? I've
noticed this in many "scenic" locations in other parts of the country. How
about a little "landscaping" to make the landscape more visible.

<BR>  Sorry, wrong story. We opt for a trip to Atlin, B.C. on our last full day
in the Yukon. This is off the Trans Canada highway and south down 60km of
fair quality gravel road. The route skirts Atlin Lake along the way, has some
nice picnic sites, but only a few good views. The road is mostly winding
through treed alleyways of the kind I thought we'd left behind in Ontario.

<BR>We drive to the Beringia Museum in the afternoon. We learn that large areas 
of the Yukon and central Alaska were not glaciated in the ice age. They
formed what is called a "mammoth steppe". This was a boreal grassland where
mammoths and other herd animals and their predators could survive. An area
cold but relatively dry in the rain-shadow of the coastal mountains. The
fertility required to support a grassland was supplied by drifting soil
called "loess" carried by the wind from glacial deposits to the west. All
this changed with the retreat of the glaciers. Fertility dropped, the soil
became more acid, forests took over, and the area could no longer support the
lifestyles of the large herd animals who required a steppe habitat.

<BR><B><P>Original diary, transcribed for TTS computer voice.</B>
<BR>    <B>July 12, Saturday.</B>   We arrive in Whitehorse mid-afternoon, pick up our
rental car and register at the Best Western hotel. Plenty of time left for a
walk around the town. Heading towards the Yukon River we end up at the
Klondike, a restored stern-wheeler. The town is large, has every kind of
shopping and commercial facility, even its own transit system. Whitehorse
caters to tourists but clearly has a life of its own after the tourists go
home.
<BR>    <B>July 13, Sunday.</B> We drive to Skagway, Alaska, via Carcross. This town is
the present day northern terminus of the Yukon and White Pass Railroad. The
tracks continue on to Whitehorse but haven't been maintained recently. 
<BR>
<BR>For us the most interesting thing is the Carcross Desert, a large area of
sand dunes on the Whitehorse side of the town. This was formed out of
wind-blown sand in pre-historic times and today is still mobile enough to
inhibit tree growth.
<BR>
<BR>The surrounding peaks are higher towards the Canada-US border but still the
view is spread wide across lakes, rocky uplands and foothills. Near the
border and the White Pass, clouds and mists roll in and the view becomes
squeezed between steep valley walls. The descent to Skagway is a long
downhill roller-coaster ride. Skagway itself is a sort of Niagara-on-the-Lake
of the north Pacific coast. A kind of theme park made up of souvenir and
jewellery stores catering to the tour boats tied up in the harbour.
<BR>
<BR>We get tickets on the White Pass excursion train along with a few thousand
tour boat passengers. We head back up the pass we've just come down in the
car. Up hair-raising embankments, past ruined trestles, over high, spindly
bridges, we grind up the narrow gauge line to the border near the head of the
pass. There we wait for an earlier train to pass us going down. 
<BR>
<BR>In Skagway again we continue our walk, checking out shop windows and
interesting buildings, then begin the drive back to Whitehorse. By the time
we get back to the hotel, Miriam and Adonis have arrived.
<BR> <B>July 14, Monday.</B> We meet Miriam and Adonis for breakfast. We all go on
another walk downtown, visit Starbuck's, then, in the afternoon, take a
longer walk along the airport perimeter fence. The airport is built on an
ancient river bank high above the town. The walk along the edge of this bank
gives fine views of Whitehorse and the Yukon River. We make plans to head
north to Dawson tomorrow.
<BR>    <B>July 15, Tuesday.</B>   On the road to Dawson, we first stop at Braeburn lodge,
a roadside watering place where the danish buns are the size of dinner
plates. We make an extended stop at Five Fingers Rapids to venture down a
trail to the water overlooking this famous navigation hazard. Steamboats had
to winch themselves past this obstacle a yard at a time. Today a few canoes
dart through the rapids going downstream, but keeping to the more
tranquil middle of the white-water channels.
<BR>
<BR>At Dawson we visit the travel bureau and ask them to find us the cheapest
hotel with the most character. They oblige and we are soon lodged in fairly
basic accommodation within a mere bottle's throw of one of Dawson's rowdier
saloons. Notwithstanding, we set off on our usual walkabout, threading
unpaved streets with wooden sidewalks. The buildings are startlingly
colourful, some in course of restoration, some decrepit, some active
businesses. We end up at the Palace Grand theatre where a musical pageant
is playing. Children have come in from all over the region to perform in a
fiddle opera about children from pioneer days who have magically come back
from the dead to tell present day kids what life back then was all
about.
<BR>
<BR>Quite a nice dinner that evening in a back street gourmet resto.
<BR>    <B>July 16, Wednesday.</B>   In the morning we drive to the top of Midnight Dome,
a viewpoint above the town. The view, for me, is quintessentially Yukon
Territory. A huge river, the Yukon, stretches from horizon to horizon,
hurrying to the Bering Strait. Mountains are on all sides, but these are the
rounded mountains of a geologically old landscape. We also see history, in
glimpses of the tailings left from goldrush days up Bonanza Creek.
<BR>
<BR>That afternoon we drive up Bonanza Creek to the old gold workings. Parks
Canada has restored a huge dredge, but this is not open today. We content
ourselves with a walk upstream. From the sound of machinery, off to the side
of the road, small-scale mining operations are still carried on.
<BR>
<BR>In the evening, Merle and I visit the Robert Service cabin on a back street
where a young man gives readings and tells the author's story. This Parks
Canada animateur confesses that he had come up here temporarily a few years
back, to check things out, but hasn't gotten around to going back south yet. In
the evening all four of us drop-in to Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Saloon
for the show. Half the audience are gamblers who take no notice of the
performance, the rest of us concentrate on the dancers and our drinks.
<BR> <B>July 17, Thursday, day 0.</B>  We drive back to Whitehorse from Dawson and
unload the rental car. Merle and I have a conference with Sea-to-Sky
outfitters this evening, to meet the other trippers and to pick up canoe
gear. Miriam and Adonis prepare for their own jaunt on the Chilkoot Pass
hike. We'll see them again later to compare notes after we've all finished
both trips.
<BR>   <B>July 18, Friday, day 1.</B>  We're picked up at our hotel by the outfitter and
taken with the other canoe trippers to our put in point on the Teslin River.
This is where the Alaska Highway crosses. Here the river is wide and opens out
into a series of narrow lakes. The current at the start is fairly sedate.
With the weather threatening rain, we have a good day's paddle of about 30km.
I now remember why I prefer the kayak to the canoe for extended trips. No
back rest in the canoe, and with the knees pushed up in front, only my
abdominal muscles keep me upright. Nevertheless, the canoes are fast and
carry an incredible amount of gear in the two middle compartments. Here, the
equipment has been tied down in a kind of daisy chain instead of being fastened
tightly to the thwarts. This is to keep everything attached to the canoe in the
event of a capsize, but to allow a swamped boat to be more easily righted and
emptied without the extra weight of the equipment to contend with.
<BR>
<BR>Under way, we raft together to get more instruction on safety procedure and
canoe handling.
<BR>    <B>July 19, Saturday, day 2.</B>   Rains and rains and never
stops. Forty days and spoils the crops. Credit that pessimistic
line to Flanders and Swan. Well, perhaps it was only drizzle
after all. I put away my Canon A640 camera and use the
expendable Olympus D40. This was my first digital camera, but I
no longer use it for anything but emergencies. See N41 notes for
more?
<BR>
<BR>    <B>July 20, Sunday, day 3.</B>  A cold dawn but promising. Sunny later on. Great
views today: cutbanks, hoodoos, mountains on the horizon. We raft the canoes
together for rest and recreation. Guides Len Webster and Kelly Kurtz read us
stories about the north by Robert Service and others. We've brought along an
entire waterproof duffel bag filled with the camp library. This evening we
find a good campsite in a park of spruce trees with incredible growths of
spongy sphagnum moss in the woods.
<BR>    <B>July 21, Monday, day 4.</B>   Rains and drizzles all night. Up at 6:30am for
breakfast and away by 8:30. Gloomy and wet for 20km, then the overcast
breaks up into statuesque cumuli. More good views of cutbanks and the
surrounding mountains.
<BR>
<BR>Lunch on a gravel bar that practically invites "Life is a beach" pictures.
More rafting to relax. Miss a few possible campsites by overshooting.
Terrific current. Difficult to land without risk of capsizing. We're
instructed in a new canoe stroke. I call it the "cut". You paddle along close
to the shore, whizzing along at 10 to 15km an hour. At a command from the
stern, the bowperson thrusts the paddle in, but diagonally forward, holding
it against the gunwale. The opposite hand holds the head of the paddle on the
outside of the chin to avoid a broken jaw if it strikes something in the
water at that speed. Meanwhile the sternperson has angled their paddle
diagonally backward. The combined effect of the manoeuvre is to quickly pivot
the canoe almost 180 degrees so that you are now facing upstream and headed
diagonally shoreward. Vigorous forward paddling against the current ferries
the canoe more gently sideways to a landing on shore.
<BR>
<BR>With likely campsites already taken we press on downriver to Hootalinqua.
This is on a modest lake at the junction of the Yukon and Teslin Rivers and
surrounded by hills and mountains. Here the Yukon adds an almost emerald
green colour to the Teslin's browner hue. Hootalinqua is an old townsite with
the ruins of several cabins and a telegraph station. We make camp and have
dinner at a picnic table overlooking the river. 75km today. Looks like we may
have a rest day in camp tomorrow.
<BR>   <B>July 22, Tuesday, day 5.</B>  Slept in till 7:30. A day in camp. What to do.
High thin clouds with blue patches. Eggs with ham McMuffin for brekkie.
Ablutions. Plans are afoot to explore the paths leading inland from the river
bank.
<BR>
<BR>A small group heads up the bank behind the telegraph station. Very steep red
earth. Then we bushwhack up moss-covered slopes to a summit on the edge of
an old cutbank. Good views of the Yukon and Teslin Rivers merging. I take a
panorama picture for assembly back home. We gather firewood on the way back
down the bank to camp.
<BR>
<BR>Hoot is repopulated in summer time with many groups of paddlers, but there's
room for a fair number of tents.
<BR>
<BR>In the afternoon another tour group lands from a natty glass-covered
powerboat out of Whitehorse. Ten people are picked up by two float-planes.
Elegant little birds, but with all those passengers they seem to take forever
to get airborne. The planes have to head up the Teslin River almost at tree
level before they disappear, circle, then reappear coming in the opposite
direction at higher altitude. Our people have given then the slightly
stand-offish reception that they richly deserve for affording a safari that
costs more per day than we have spent on a week.
<BR>
<BR>That evening, stories round the campfire about travel horror shows, bus
breakdowns, lost luggage. London, England instead of London, Ontario, that
sort of thing. Enough material for a book.
<BR>   <B>July 23, Wednesday, day 6.</B>  We leave Hooterlingua for Big Salmon,
cloudy-dull. A few minutes paddling downstream and we stop at Hootalinqua
Island to view the wreck of the Norcom. This steamer is still up on blocks,
but rapidly falling into ruin as the weather disintegrates its woodwork. Len
Webster says he remembers when it was still safe to clamber aboard and
explore. Today the whole structure is near collapse. You could fall through
the hull with the ship's iron boiler coming down on top of you.
<BR>
<BR>More paddling and rafting, rafting and paddling... We make camp above a steep
ten foot gravel bank. Merle and I execute the "cut" manoeuvre to perfection
this time. Like clockwork. A precision landing on a narrow gravel shelf.
Everyone pitches in pitching heavy packs up the bank where more hands are
waiting to haul the gear to safety. The canoes are pulled out and tied down.
Our tents go up in record time. Golly, we're getting efficient at this. The
sun is peeking through holes in the cloud cover by dinner time. We spend
hours nostalgizing about old movies round the campfire this evening.
<BR>    <B>July 24, Thursday, day 7.</B>  We depart Big Salmon. Cloudy-bright, briefly
sunny. In the afternoon I try "drafting" behind Kelly, the leader in our
formation. Following very closely, no more than ten feet behind another canoe
does seem to make progress slightly easier. The downside is that you use up a
lot of nervous energy attempting to track the sometimes erratic movements of
the leader. I remember trying this during a ten mile footrace in Welland. I
accidently stepped on the heel of my windbreak's running shoe and had to
sprint from there on to avoid his wrath.
<BR>
<BR>We camp at Twin Creeks after the usual "cut" manoeuvre to land the canoes.
The current is sluicing by the campsite at about 10km an hour. I drop a
paddle over the side and have to leap into the water for it. Luckily only up
to the knees. Dry two hours later.
<BR>
<BR>This is an old dredging site, "windrows" of tailings are still visible under
the moss. Another rest day tomorrow. We have only about 20km to go before the
final pull out. Some of the others will go on to camp at Carcross where they
will continue on down river to Dawson.
<BR>
<BR>About 50km today.
<BR>
<BR>    <B>July 25, Friday, day 8.</B>  Twin Creeks, rest day. It drizzles all night, some
sun in the morning. Today, Judy, one of our trippers sees a lynx on the
riverbank. I wander up and down looking at ruined cabins. One
is still fixable. This area has quite a few good campsites with firepits and
logs arranged for sitting. This reminds me what a hunger I have for somewhere
comfortable to sit. Something with a back to lean against. Our Kansas
campers have comfy-looking director's chairs, awkward shapes but easy to tie
onto the top of a canoe load.
<BR>
<BR>Too much napping today, restless for action. Wine for supper. Mood subdued,
or simply tired? It is the end of this leg of the trip for Merle and I. Four
of our number are not going on to Dawson. I sit on the butt of a poplar tree
on the riverbank and meditate on the human condition. The river sluices past.
Who can step into the same river twice? (Heracleitos) Since we've been
camping at this sport, yesterday's water has moved 200 or more kilometers
closer to the sea. But the river is still not empty and the sea is not
filled. What gives?
<BR>
<BR>    <B>July 26, Saturday.</B>  Up at 6am for a 7:15 start. One hour, 45 minutes to
Little Salmon. Check N41-019 below.
<BR>
<BR>    <B>July 27, Sunday.</B>   Merle and I walk up the hill to the car rental depot
near the airport and drive back down for lunch. We then head for Zuchini(?)
Hot Springs to soak out the accumulated stiffness of our canoe trip. In line
for tickets with scads of Cherman Sprachers. The air in the pool area is cool
but the water pleasantly warm, even hot in the inlet area. Distant snow clad
peaks on the horizon, many kids playing. It seems that the locals come here
as well as the tourists. You can purchase a season pass. Apparently the place
is open in the winter. What fun, after a heavy day of dog-team mushing,
snow-machine repairs, or stoking the boilers of abandoned steamboats on the
marge of Lake Laberge.
<BR>
<BR>Miriam and Adonis are catching a flight home this evening. But we still have
two more days for tourist reconaissance, options Kluane and Atlin.
<BR>
<BR>On the way back to Whitehorse we detour to the shores of Lake Laberge.
Spectacular spot to camp of have a cottage. Plenty of open water and rocky
shorelines to explore. Might even be a good spot to have a sailboat. 
<BR>
<BR>Later that afternoon we explore Miles Canyon, upstream from the power
generating station. Water levels have been raised by the dam, so the canyon
is not as deep as it used to be. Powerboats come through it full throttle.
Nothing like the hazard to navigation of the olden days,
although of course, you can't get past the power dam without a portage. So
this is, in effect, the upper limit to navigation on the Yukon River. Below
this point, you could, I believe, drift, paddle or motor all the
way to the Bering Strait.
<BR>
<BR><B>July 28, Monday.</B>  Well breakfasted, we head off to Kluane country,
specifically, Kathleen Lake. Arriving about 11am we set out to hike up the
King's Throne, an impressive cirque round the side of the lake. Park rangers
engaged in a parking lot project look at us sceptically and quote times of
two to four hours for the hike. They don't say if this is one way or return.
We take two hours fifteen minutes going up.
<BR>
<BR>Many photo panoramas and wildflower pictures later we arrive at the cirque
with snowbanks still present from last winter. The trail is fairly good
although quite steep on the upper reaches. We get temporarily lost on the
way back down to the lake and are pointed in the right direction by
francophone hikers from Quebec. Plan "B" would have been to continue
downhill to the shore of the lake where the campground would be
visible down the shore. This is our first serious climb of the year.
<BR>
<BR>We continue north on the Alaska Highway to a point just past Haines Junction.
From this vicinity, enormous mountains are visible in the west. One peak,
standing above the others, is entirely covered in snow and ice. At a Parks
Canada World Heritage Site, we can't see the view for the shrubbery in the
way. Do they have a fixation about not cutting trees? I've noticed this in
many "scenic" locations in other parts of the country. How about a little
"landscaping" to make the scenery visible.
<BR>
<BR>We head "home" to Whitehorse.
<BR>
<BR><B>July 29, Tuesday.</B>  "Fred felt Nora's hot breath on his shoulder and knew that
they were about to exchange the bow and stern paddling positions for the less
familiar midships position."
<BR>
<BR>Sorry, wrong story. We opt for a trip to Atlin, B.C. on our last full day in
the Yukon. This is off the Trans Canada and south down 60km of fair quality
gravel road. The route skirts lakes along the way, has some nice picnic
sites, but only a few good views. The road is mostly winding through treed
alleyways of the kind I thought we'd left behind in Ontario.
<BR>
<BR>But Atlin itself is a gem, a decrepit, undervisited, but picturesque lakeside
town with boats, floatplanes, a campground, a museum, and very fine Alpine
vistas across the water. No restos are open and we have to buy lunch stuff
at a grocery store. You can make this a base of operations for trips round
the lake, or to the glaciers and high country on the opposite side. Atlin
had its own goldrush after the Klondike, and afterwards supported a large
tourist industry via a steamer crossing the lake with connections to
Whitehorse.
<BR>
<BR>Back to Whitehorse via Carcross.
<BR>
<BR><B>July 30, Wednesday.</B>  On our last day, we visit the old Anglican log church,
then later, hear a retelling of local biography in the town cemetery.
Afterwards we stroll around town, listless. Not quite hungry enough for
lunch, not quite keen enough to find anything fascinating to do. Such is the
final day of airline passengers waiting for an evening flight. Too tired for
a serious walk, we check out of the hotel. A rental car is now our only base
of operations.
<BR>
<BR>We drive to the Beringia Museum in the afternoon. We learn that large areas 
of the Yukon and central Alaska were not glaciated in the ice age. They
formed what is called a "mammoth steppe". This was a boreal grassland where
herd animals and their predators could survive. An area cold but relatively
dry in the rain-shadow of the coastal mountains. The fertility required to
support a grassland was supplied by drifting soil called "loess" carried by
the wind from glacial deposits to the west. All this changed with the retreat
of the glaciers. Fertility dropped, the soil became more acid, forests took
over, and the area could no longer support the lifestyles of the large herd
animals who required a steppe habitat.
<BR>
<BR>We relinquish the rental car in the airport parking lot. After a brief
attempt to visit the Transportation Museum at closing time, we sit in the
airport lounge eating chunks of cheese and waiting for our fate with Air
Canada. The bags that were checked free of charge on the outbound journey now
cost us $30 extra to return. My attention wanders away from such irritating
trivia. I drift back to those long stretches of the Teslin River, with the
current speeding us across Beringia and toward the Bering Strait.

<BR> notes:
<BR> 11-05-24: Finished distributing diary entries, recording TTS clips
Corrupt file noticed this morning. Lost some work done at queenston. Mods to
PTF.SCR command to improve identification of saved versions. Created
ALT-Q.SCR which can be used within edit session to save version and return.
Suspect the problem was caused by the "alt-I" cmd (insert
clipboard). This was used many times
in succession in the same edit session. Works by deleting all lines to end
of file, these go to clipboard, then appending clipboard. Might be some bug
in this procedure trigged by repeated use. Use ALT-Q frequently
to save during any massive edit session.
<BR> 15-02-25: DON'T use ALT-Q before testing. Didn't seem to work today.
Yesterday restored SOAM.PTF from TEMP backup. Could have been caused by
problem like above. See C:(slash)TEMP for versions of any edit session processed
by PTF.SCR
<BR> 14-03-12: edited text, pics to "hot springs". Needs review of placing on
screen also.
<BR> 14-03-13: edit pics complete. Next, screen placement.
<BR> 14-03-17: done screen placement. Also seems to work on narrower aspect

<I>0335-30 </I> - <B>Broomhill Bed and Breakfast.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Heading south from Scotland toward the Lake District, we
take a stab at the map. The town of Windermere seems central and
we let the local tourist information office set us up with
accommodation at a bed and breakfast place called Broomhill. The
proprietors, Mr. and Mrs. Potter, welcome us into their home.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0335/0335-18.jpeg">
<I>0335-18 </I> - <B>Down the garden path.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Our room overlooks Lake Windermere. Beneath the window is a wild
growth of rhododendrons and way down at the foot of the garden
stands a sundial with a gate in the hedge behind it. Is this a
message from the Great Travel Agent in the Sky? Tempus Fugit,
perhaps, or, Gather ye Flowers While ye May.

<I>0335-13 </I> - <B>Queen Adelaide's Hill.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We hurry off to get in some walking. Queen Adelaide's Hill
beside the lake offers no real challenge, but provides a fine
view to orient us to our new surroundings.

advantage of the hot weather near the end of May, people are
swimming in the lake, but we've not thought to bring bathing
suits.

<BR>    Back at Broomhill, we lie in bed sipping Scotch whiskey and
watching the sun go down over the balcony. The lady at the

<BR>    Grasmere is a likely spot for a short excursion from
Windermere. The town is full of boutiques, eateries and
picturesque houses.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0335/0335-24.jpeg">
<I>0335-24 </I> - <B>Dove Cottage.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Dove Cottage, Wordworth's residence from 1799 to 1808, is
located in Grasmere and worth a visit. It has an arbour and garden seat in
the back yard. Compare to Woodside.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0335/0335-26.jpeg">
<I>0335-26 </I> - <B>Above Grasmere.</B><xxx>

<BR>    After our pilgrimmage to the stamping ground of Romantic
poetry's patron saint, we walk up into the hills behind
Grasmere. Actually, the image of Wordsworth "stamping" doesn't
seem to fit, but "tramping" probably does. The poet did a lot of
walking.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0335/0335-27.jpeg">
<I>0335-27 </I> - <B>Alcock Tarn.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Our destination is Alcock Tarn, an unpreposessing body of
water, mainly frequented by sheep. The tarn was certainly known
to Wordworth, being almost directly behind his house.

Lake Windermere and walk by public pathways through the fields
toward the village of Sawrey. This must be Saint
Somebody-in-the-Fields.

<I>0335-38 </I> - <B>Stile, public right-of-way.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Heading back to Lake Windermere, we decide to walk
cross-country via public laneways. Public rights-of-way across
private land are a wonderful English institution. For the urban
hiker, they create a sense of actually having a right to be in
the rural countryside, as opposed to being a mere spectator,
nose pressed to some vehicle window.

<BR>    A steam yacht cruises serenely over the waters. Looks like
it has passengers on board. We begin wondering if there's any way to
get a ride and experience this outmoded form of transportation.

<BR>    Cows graze in the public park between the ferry dock and the
centre of Bowness. It seems a little odd at first, but then,
what could be more reasonable? The cows mow the grass, fertilize
the soil, bring in revenue, and add visual interest.

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-09.jpeg">
<I>0336-09 </I> - <B>Picturesque rural property.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Determined to do at least one significant hike while in the Lake
District, we start out to have a go at Helvellyn, one of the district's
higher peaks. This cottage is located close to the beginning of our route and
near a convenient bus stop. (Incidentally, the British prefer to call their
hikes, "rambles".)

<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-12a.jpeg">
<I>0336-12a </I> - <B>Tongue Gill.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Our path leads up Tongue Gill and continues toward that dip
on the left horizon. At first we're under the impression this is
the major part of the ascent, but it turns out to be only the
approach.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-17a.jpeg">
<I>0336-17a </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>    Looking back from a point near the head of Tongue Gill, you can see the
lush valley bottom north of Grasmere where we began the ascent. A squadron of
fighter jets on excercises swept up the valley while we were walking. The
name Gill or Ghyll means narrow stream or valley. Origin Norse.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-19.jpeg">

<BR>    !Over the first ridge and down the opposite side to
Grisedale Tarn. Merle is on the path below. At this point you're
on the shoulders of several major summits. Tiny figures cross
the moors in the far distance. Space recedes in all directions. 
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-21a.jpeg">
<I>0336-21a </I> - <B>Grisedale Tarn.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Skirting the tip of Grisedale Tarn, we aim for that scarred pathway up
the mountainside on the left. The hiker's "high" begins in this kind of
terrain. You have a wonderful sense of being able to plan your route for a
great distance ahead. It's a powerful sensation, not given to dwellers of
canyons, urban or otherwise.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-24a.jpeg">
<I>0336-24a </I> - <B>Grisedale Tarn.</B><xxx>

<BR>    !Grisedale tarn, looking back. Distance translates into
purpose, keen desire to journey to that far point where the eye
alights. A powerful sense of expectation, gradually translated
by hard work into clear achievement. Not many projects in life
offer that kind of straight forward satisfaction.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-26a.jpeg">
<I>0336-26a </I> - <B></B><xxx>

<BR>    We bear right off the beaten path and tramp along the knife
edge looking down into eastern valleys. Each summit is an
aspiration. Each valley contains a traditional way of life. Or
it did, before the coming of the automobile. This is Grisedale
Beck looking toward the tip of Ullswater on the top left.

<BR>    The ridge path to the summit is just beyond the high point
on the ridge to the right. By tackling each eminence along the
route, we're able to claim several additional peaks to add to
the list. !Dollywaggon Pike, High Crag, Nethermost Pike.
<BR>
<P><IMG SRC="./DR/GRA1/0336/0336-33.jpeg">
<I>0336-33 </I> - <B>Peaty soil</B><xxx>

<BR>    Where sheep and hikers haven't worn it away, the soil can be fairly
thick, even at 3000 feet altitude. I'd be interested in a microscopic
examination, to discover whether these peaks ever had forest cover. My
obscure interest in Britain's forestry probably stems from a background as a
colonial in a still heavily forested country, plus a youthful fascination with
Robin Hood's Sherwood Forest.

<BR>    !Connecting ridges and trails enough for many another day. This is one of
those pictures that sums up much of the charm of high-level walking. Those
wayfaring paths, leading off the edges of visibility, are a concrete reminder
of fruitful possibilities in life. And perhaps of hazards too. No other
context provides, for me, quite as strong a union of metaphor and
reality. It's like walking into a story, a lucid dream, where you have the
vision but are fully awake at the same time.

<BR>    Merle gazes down on Red Tarn, with Striding Edge just above
her head. The name alone makes me want to reach down and tighten
the laces of my hiking boots. Actually, we've been wearing
sneakers the whole distance. Today the route is dry and the
weather perfect.

<BR>    !The highest sheep in England, the Herdwick variety. All day long they
drift uphill, looking for cool breezes. By the time we arrive, they're
standing on the summit looking plaintively around, nothing left to do but
jump over the edge. Our daughter in Welland keeps a few sheep, not this
variety. But she lacks the scenic amenities of Helvellyn.

<BR>    Roman soldiers, looking down from their ramparts might have
viewed a scene like this. In places, the Roman roads run
straight over the tops of the hills, providing rapid
communication and good visibility. The army could then cast a
protective eye over the local manor houses and keep
freedom-fighters and brigands under control. If this was the
reason for putting the roads up on top, then the hills must have
been deforested at least as far back as the Roman period.
Amazing what environmental changes you can make with only an
axe.

<BR>    Near the opposite shore of the lake, we throttle back to
dead slow while the Captain prepares tea on a Windermere tea
kettle. Drinking water is brought to the boil in that
samovar-like tank. A heat-exchanger coil uses steam from the
ship's boiler to heat the water.

<BR>    Tourists in the bow wait patiently during the tea-making
operation. See the smiles on those faces? Nothing disturbs their
serenity. The engine is so quiet as to be almost inaudible, even
at cruising speed. The machinery is well-made, perfectly
adjusted and nearly vibration-free.

<I>0338-17 </I> - <B>Captain Leach.</B><xxx>

<BR>    Captain Leach had interesting experiences during the war,
but for a long period afterwards, because of a demand for his specialised
knowledge, had to sit around waiting to be demobilised. He's 70
years old.

<BR>    He spent much of the idle time writing up his experiences.
Pages from his scrapbooks and diaries are on display in the
museum, enlivened by his own photographs and cartoons of
military life.

<BR>    On the return voyage we find ourselves wondering why such a
peaceful mode of transportation died out. It's like hot-air
ballooning, but with full control over your direction.

<BR>    Does the rest of the world really prefer noisy
transportation, or have we all gone deaf?

<I>0338-22 </I> - <B>Orrest Head.</B><xxx>

<BR>    On our last ramble in the Lake district, we ascend Orrest
Head, a very short but rewarding walk near the edge of
Windermere town. This park was donated to the public by the
previous owner of the property. Merle sits with water bottle in
hand and her feet up.

<I>0338-23 </I> - <B>Lake Windermere from Orrest Head.</B><xxx>

<BR>    We eat supper and lie under a tree overlooking Lake
Windermere. Sometime tomorrow we have to catch a train back to
London, but not just yet.

<BR>History {hist}
<BR> 07-04-17: finished hi-res scans. Sound seems to come from inside a
bottle. Fixable or re-record?
<BR>
<BR> 07-05-19: finished picture edits except spotting. Renamed sound clips using
alt-x/z/z6(?) option. Tested the show. Pictures previously scanned as wall
prints may have been sharpened too much -- gritty looking. These are the "A"
versions. Try using the more recent versions.
<BR>
<BR> 07-05-20: The above, done. Repaired 2 sound clips for stumbles. Voice is
lower today. Chopped out some lower freq.
<BR>
<BR> 12-12-07: The T89c pictures were an earlier transcription attempt:
by photographing the projector screen, low resolution. Ignore.
<BR> Two side-by-side vertical format pics work well. See Tongue Gill, 0336-17a.
The pics can be both put on the screen, no delay without sound, then repeated
with sound and no screen erase.
<BR> 14-03-05: Edited pics for dust specs to 0337-18. Seeing the pics enlarged
for the first time recently, noticed many interesting details that don't
always show up in a slide show. 14-03-06: finished dust spotting.
<BR> 15-03-04: Cleanup for HTML.

<BR><P><B>2011-06-08  BURA meeting, GLB club</B>
<BR>11-06-08  BURA AGM. At the Glenridge Lawn-Bowling Club. Have to take pics by
available light. Only a few keepers. Hope everyone forgets by the time the
next newsletter goes to press that Derek was taking pictures. I hate flash
photography, partly because of the deer-in-the-headlights look that it gives
people. Partly also because of not having the knack of jollying people into
interesting poses. This is probably something I should learn. To counter my
tendency towards scenery, still lives and things.
<BR>
<BR>The Schutzes at Woodside for dinner after the meeting. The others discuss the
olden days at B.U., and I, when I can shoehorn a word in with Herb, the
problems of photo management if you have a big collection. He supplies, out
of his own resources, most of the pictures he uses to illustrate his books on
European history.

<BR>11-06-15 Wed  Bike recon.  The Steve Bauer Trail. Start at
Pelham Town Square. S. on Station St. Trail proper starts at
Station St. and Port Robinson St. A small parking lot. Has
pulverised stone surface. S. toward Welland.
<BR>
<BR>Trail curves S.E.-ward to S. of Thorold Rd. Continues S. along
Prince Charles Dr. on separated path. Last 1km to Welland R. is
rougher but passable. We turn back at the bridge. About 15km,
return.
<BR>
<BR>11-06-17 Fri  Bike recon.  The Poison Ivy Trail. Park near
Hansler and Holland Rd. A dead-end at 406. N. to 406 tunnel, on
to Youngblutt Rd. Loose gravel, coarse crushed stone to
Beaverdams Rd. Nearly impassable. Back S. and on to Merrittville
Hwy. and across. Again stopped by loose stone. Looks like trail
continues to Fonthill. Surface not suitable for skinny-tire
roadbikes. Route follows old RR right-of-way. Peculiar
undulations in many places. A regular roller-coaster set of
waves. 15ft crest to crest. Plenty of birds and plant life in
the surrounding fields.
<P><B>2011-06-18  Biking</B>
<BR>11-06-18 Sat.  Merle on BTC duty today to help in a marathon run ending at
Queenston. D. to living room to brood on the artistic enterprise,
specifically the notebook/ sketchbook/ fieldbook issue. He has spend a
considerable portion of his artistic brooding time (and computer programming
time) plotting methodological improvements in diary and album keeping. These
photo albums are the latest iteration of that process.
<BR>
<BR>After. we drive to NOTL via Lakeshore Rd to look for
strawberries for Diana. Back to the Port Weller beach beside the
STP. Breeze, westerly. Good! Biked through Malcolmson Park, the
way blocked by fallen tree. Portaged bikes. Then down the
Welland Canal trail to Queenston and back More than 15k, without
any effort. 28C, cool breeze, still air, but we are moving
along at about 15kph. Headwinds in both directions. Odd till you
think about it. Like a round trip that goes uphill in both
directions. Or, like the distance from Toronto to St.
Catharines: close to 200km, A major safari. But the distance
from St. Catharines to Toronto is more like 100km, a mere hop,
convenient for us to visit you. At least that's the way some
people see it. You know who you are.
<BR>On the Welland Canal W. bank, Port Weller.

<BR><P><B>2011-06-19  At the Silvers'</B>
Sunday.  To the back patio for Fathers' Day. Bubbly lunch, bubbly people,
Effervescent weather. Or was it effervescent people and bubbly weather? 
<BR> The big old pine tree leaning over the back of their condo is to be removed
at $1000 a pop. Too much shade. Too many squirrels. Too many pine needles in
the eavestrough.
<BR> Following this, south, to Arts Place, Port Colborne, for Linda Hankin's show
opening. A small crowd, but much chatter. A red dot on an empty wall space.
Sold! I can visualize sawing out a portion of plaster to take home. How to
explain the importance of dry-wall art to a sceptical viewer. 
<BR> Anne and Marc-Ivan Audet-Giroux arrive. (Used to think the name was
O'Degiroux, of Franco-Irish origin.) We visit them later in the Loch Ness
golf complex and housing development near Welland. We're given a tour of the
perennial border and the basement ductwork. Anne's sister and her husband
arrive. They know Zweibrucken, Germany, where the Richardses were stationed in
the 1950s. We natter extensively about the olden days at No.3 Fighter Wing,
the R.C.A.F. Base, before departure. I have recently scanned all my colour
slides taken when we lived there.

<BR><P><B>2011-06-22  Walk, Port Dalhousie</B>
<BR>11-06-22 Wed  A walk in Port Dalhousie. Our usual pier-to-pier
route. Start at the E. pier parking lot. Water seems higher this year,
within a foot of the pier surface. Swallow nests under the roof
of the outer lighthouse.
<BR>
<BR>Back at the hydro dam where Lakeshore Rd crosses the Pond, we
decide to try the new footbridge across Martindale Pond instead
of continuing to the W. pier. A fresh route. The remains of an
old wreck is visible from the bridge. We end up going back to
the car via side streets and Ontario St. Pass Kayo R.'s old
house on Ziraldo. Wood chips are available on a help-yourself
basis at the old Welland Canal entrance in Optimists' Park, off
Ontario St. The garden needs more roughage to conter clay
constipation.

Tuesday. Interior house-painting done. Two rooms. $300 labour + $130
materials = $430 for kitchen and bedroom ceilings, and some walls. Was
supposed to take 3-4 days. Late as usual. 8 days all told, of which 2 were
our own put-away and put-back days. The 2 unsightly ceiling spots are
history, we hope. And now we have our kitchen, bedroom and dining-room back.
<BR>
<BR>Welcome to the Mad Hatter's Tea Party in the dining room  where we stored
everything from the kitchen shelves. The March Hare is seen in the
background. Late as usual, for a very important completion date.

Thursday. Merle is minding Arts Place Gallery today in Port
Colborne. She goes by car. Derek sets off after lunch on his
bike.
<BR>
<BR> Home to Port Robinson         1:09 hrs:min   16.0 km
<BR> P.R. to Main St, Welland       :26            6.9
<BR> M.S.W to Port Colborne, A.P.  1:35           13.1

<BR> Total                         3:10           36.0 
<BR>
<BR>Past dragon boat training on the way south at the rowing
club quarters. Someone beats a drum to pace the paddlers.
Recalls the galley scenes in the movie Ben Hur. Beside
the docks, hordes of muscular young women wait their turn
on the water. Recalls memories of Miriam at the St. Catharines
rowing club in Port Dalhousie, and Anna Kazdan's amazement that
the girls picked up their own rowing shell with no help from
the boys.
<BR>
<BR>Past Dain City, depletion symptoms already. Headwinds. Totally
exhausted on arrival in Port Colborne. I flop down on the
gallery floor to rest. Merle attempts to get me a drink from the
variety store across the street. She's stopped by a visitor to
the gallery who natters on for 30 minutes about Life, the
Universe and Everything. But you never know, he might be a
customer.

<BR><P><B>2011-07-01  BTC pig roast</B>
<BR>11-07-01 Fri. Canada Day. Bruce Trail pig roast.  To Warner Rd, Andy
Panko's place. Early, so Merle can help set up. Derek, despite
the heat, sets off on bike to explore Warner Rd. and
tributaries. Visit Warner burying ground and that Georgian house
we used to admire in our real-estate-admiring days. It was once
said that a dissolute Toronto artist lived there, and held wild
parties. Up the escarpment, across the RR tracks (bridge blocked
to auto traffic) into the edge of Niagara Falls, then back down
the hill again. East on Warner Rd to a riding stable and return to
Andy's.

<BR>11-07-01 Fri  At the Pig Roast.  Returned to the Panko place
from bike riding, hot, tired and seriously depleted. Sat like that
in the shade for most of the afternoon till evening, moving
very little. Roused up to take a few pictures, including pig's
heads for the grotty file.
<BR> Margaret K. wearing flag head-dress. Pete K. masterminding a
BBQing pig on his own spit. Two more pigs roasting on our
host's spits. The crowd gathers. Wine vouchers available. Jazz group
from Collegiate playing. Eventually plates of salad and pig
meat for all.

<BR>11-07-01 Friday evening.  Home at 8pm after the pig roast.
Collapse into bed. Up every half hour all night to pee.
Burning sensation, fever. This continues till next day, 6pm,
Saturday. Fever 38.7C. Merle drives me to the Dieu, Urgent Care
Department. First in line, report symptoms, donate urine
sample, taken seriously. After a brief wait, given intravenous
anti-biotic. Admitted on the basis of a quick phone call to the
General.
<BR> Pass a bad night, peeing boiling water, pushing IV pole in and
out of the bathroom, listening to the machine's irritating
clockwork ticking. Two more days and nights like this.
Temperature finally down below 37 on the 5th. The doctor
visiting in that day, with a cheshire cat smile on her face,
says: Rejoice, you had E. Coli not C. Difficile.

<BR><P><B>2011-07-05  Home</B>
Tuesday.  Home from St. Catharines General Hospital. Weak but
feeling miraculously better. This is the real Rapture Day.
Coming up Hampton from a visit to the mailbox, am struck by how
lovely everything seems: a perfect day, heightened colours,
objects seem clearer, more vibrant. Un qualite de la lumiere,
peut etre. Even the shapes of trees, bushes have an almost
surreal beauty.
<BR>
<BR>The world looked ugly, even nauseating on my admission to
hospital. A place of wonder on my homecoming. Survivor euphoria?
Rapture of the discharged?
<BR>
<BR>Our Last Supper for Diana, Danny and Merle before their Siamese
trip. (I'm staying home.)  The food is highly edible. Babette
Feastish, even. Another cheery note: am now entertaining a
jumping spider on my computer monitor. It attacks the mouse
pointer when I move it on the screen. I love jumping spiders.

<P>    Fielding made for the centre of their main position on the
rim of the gulley. "Burns, keep an eye on Garner. Make sure he
stays by the fuse."
<P>    "I was just going to mention that, sir. Looks like we'll
have a fine explosion, right enough ... if the amount of powder
Garner put into the mine is any indication." 
<P>    "Amount of powder?  Exactly how much did he use?"
<P>    "Twenty-three tins, sir. We've only got but six left, an'
one of 'em's already broached for the men to use." 
<P>    "Good God! That's hardly enough for a battle. I told him
<I>two or three</I> tins." Fielding's voice had risen to a regimental
sergeant-major's pitch. The men began casting worried looks in
his direction and he dropped his voice to a hiss. "What'll we do
now? We'll be overrun when we use up the rest of the powder and
cartridges."
<P>    "Look out, they're coming," yelled a trooper.
<P>    To Fielding's plea for last-minute advice, Burns could only
suggest: "I'd guess then, sir, we'd best give them a good
singeing with the mine before they get in too close. Think
I'll just check that fuse again." 
<P>    Fielding shook a dazed-looking trooper by the arm.
"MacPherson, go to Fox down the stream bank where the heliograph
is set up. Give him the following message to send to Mr. Harris:
'smoke and mirrors.' Got it?" He'd already forgotten the numeric
signals they'd agreed upon earlier that morning.
<P>    "'Smoke and mirrors', sir? Right away, sir. Smoke and
mirrors. Smoke and mirrors ..." MacPherson ran off down the
gulley, but a moment later he was back, plucking at Fielding's
sleeve. "It doesn't make sense, sir. What's it mean: 'fire and
mirrors'?"
<P>    "'<I>Smoke</I> and mirrors,'" Fielding corrected, "Now be off
with you. Mr. Harris must receive the signal right away so he
can distract the Indians." He'd almost said Lieutenant Harris
without thinking. In view of recent changes in responsibility,
it did have an authentic ring.
<P>    The main group of Indians, at least two hundred and fifty
strong, were steadily advancing in a compact body just as
required by the Fielding strategy. A cluster of chiefs kept to
the centre, identified by the gleam of sunlight on feathered
war-bonnets. Captain Ames had come up to assess the situation
for himself. Over Fielding's shoulder he watched the expanding
front approach.
<P>    "Bless my soul, I had no idea it had gone as far as ...
<I>this</I>. We must prepare for the worst." The Captain's composure
wilted still further as the flower of Blood chivalry cantered
into closer view. The lances of individual warriors could now be
picked out. 
<P>    "I do hope, sir, we can keep things under tight control.
It's the possibility of a disorganized retreat that disturbs me
most. ... Perhaps -- to avoid dividing the attention of the men
-- you should go below and take charge of the horses and
equipment ... just in case we have to make a run for it." 
<P>    "Heaven preserve us, Fielding. Not a rout, surely. You must
do everything in your power to prevent it."
<P>    The Captain hurried down the slope and his white head could
be seen bobbing about in the confusion of the gulley, where a
few distracted men on the sick list were busy preparing weapons
and ammunition for those who manned the firing line above. 
<P>    At a hundred yards range, the waiting troopers began to stir
uneasily where they crouched, waiting for the signal to fire.
<P>    "Wave that flag one more time, Burns."
<P>    But this time, Fielding gave the order with no conviction
that diplomacy could stem the warrior tide.  A shot was fired
and the pathetic rag of peace waved. In answer, the Indians
spurred their horses to the gallop. The thudding of hooves
became a roar and the ground reverberated with a thrumming drum
beat.
<P>    "This is it, sir," said a trooper, making his final peace
with God and his new commanding officer.
<P>    "Ready, Garner?" shouted Burns. "When I yell, you light the
fuse. And you men, fire at the ones who get through the blast."
He was taking nicely to the role of senior sergeant, noted
Fielding. 
<P>    The charge began to look more like an avalanche of
horseflesh seething downhill toward them. From the Indians rose
a shrill war-cry: they would avenge their dead comrades,
retrieve their stolen horses, and wipe the white intruders from
the face of the earth, even if half of them were to go up in a
holocaust of black powder. 
<P>    Out of the corner of his eye Fielding detected a minute
flash of light on the western horizon. There it was again,
sparkling in a kind of weird repetition.  His eyes flicked back
to the charging Indians.
<P>    "Now, Garner, now," shrieked Burns. The match dipped
obediently in Garner's shaking hand. A snake of white smoke
twisted across the prairie, its head glowing with venom. "Lor',
didn't think he'd drop that match so quick," said Burns under
his breath. Garner dived for cover in the ravine.
<P>    The rest watched, hypnotized at the expected meeting of
titanic forces. Tracking the erratic windings of a shallow ditch
dug in the hours of darkness, the irresistible impulse sped to
meet the oncoming flood of warriors.
<P>    It halted abruptly at the shallow depression concealing the
mine, its force dissipating at the end of a long caterpillar of
pale smoke. Fielding gazed across the prairie at the flailing
hooves consuming the remaining distance between them. The fuse
had gone out, leaving only a thin line of muskets to shield them
from the fury of the Bloods. 
<P>    He was just turning to shout encouragement when a
mirage-like ripple distorted his vision. Then a whole section of
prairie sod sprang upward, propelled on a pink blast of
excruciating flame. A fat mushroom cloud billowed outward and
rose vertically, trailing a pillar of falling debris on all
their heads. 
<P>    Over in the west that strange flicker of darting sunlight
persisted. In front of them, the pall of smoke and dust was now
drifting away to reveal seven or eight Indian riders thrown, the
rest milling in circles.
<P>    "Damn it, sir,"  agonized Burns, "If only it'd hung fire a
few seconds longer. Now we'll have to hold them off as best we
can.  All right you men, make every shot count. When I give the
order ..."
<P>    The flicker of light in the west had grown stronger, the
flashes seeming to emanate from an approaching squall. The smoke
and mirrors at last. About time, thought Fielding. Good old
Harris. Fox had gotten him the message with the heliograph, just
in time. As the dust cloud grew, they began to hear continuous
pops of gunfire in the distance.
<P>    The smoke of the explosion was now only a faint haze, the
last remnant of twenty-three tins of precious black powder. And
the attackers were on the verge of reforming themselves with no
more serious hurt than shattered eardrums. Above the confusion,
the cries of the chiefs could be heard attempting to rally their
warriors.
<P>    Louder bangs of weaponry came from the west. Now the dust
cloud had grown to a storm, capturing the attention of both
besiegers and besieged. 
<P>    "What d'you make of that, sir?" wondered Burns. "How d'you
suppose six men could make all that dust, just by dragging a few
sticks of brushwood?"
<P>    Trooper Fox from the heliograph station panted up the slope.
"More Indians, sir. A couple of hundred, at least. I could see
them from the riverbank."
<P>    Scattered glints of sunlight were still coming from the base
of the dustcloud as it neared the opposite bank of the stream.
That much was going as planned. Harris' men had been given
pocket mirrors to flash in the hope of convincing the Bloods
that a relief column was on the way. But another army of Indians
was definitely not part of the plan. As a result of Garner's
error, they already had insufficient powder to resist even their
original attackers for long.
<P>    The new band of warriors split in two as it approached the
far side of the stream. One half remained opposite the embattled
whites. The rest splashed across and advanced toward the Bloods
who were still debating the merits of charging through the
smoke-blackened no-man's land. But instead of supporting the
attackers, the new arrivals stationed themselves to block
further advance. 
<P>    "I assume that Harris and his men must be safe." Fielding
narrowed his eyes as he tried to see through the clouds on the
far bank. "They couldn't have signalled if they'd been captured.
Burns, tell the men to hold their fire. And send up a green
rocket to recall Mr. Harris. I think I should take a closer look
at that mob across the stream."
<P>    From a point near the heliograph station, he watched as
a diminutive figure advanced to the opposite bank on foot.
Troopers poked weapons from the shrubbery at the mouth of
the gulley to cover him as he stepped forward to
investigate. The Indians must want to parley after all. Now,
at least, he'd have a chance to spin out their shortage of
powder.
<P>    A pang of recognition struck him as Summer Rain waded
through the shallows in her finely-beaded moccasins. He
splashed across the mud to take her hand, water filling his
high black cavalry boots through numerous cracks in the
leather. They stood together holding hands and sinking in
the ooze while he gazed into the face of the woman he could
have led to the ends of the earth, if only he'd chosen to
follow her. Behind him a signal rocket went up from the
gulley with a whoosh and burst overhead in a shower of green
stars. 
<P>    "I have found my people at last," she said, "and War-bow has
returned. He has taken vengeance on his enemies and is now Chief
of the Piegans. He will be my husband after all. Come, I will
take you to parley with him."
<P>    And, she might have added, a damn good thing you didn't
follow me home. Otherwise, the two of you would have had to
fight to the finish for my hand in marriage.
<P>    Harris was now standing on the edge of the ravine with
Burns. Fielding sent a message to inform him and the
troopers of his departure with Summer Rain to meet War-bow.
As word of the parley spread, the men on the bank of the
gulley turned in his direction, and at the instigation of
Burns, raised three cheers that echoed across the stream and
caused the waiting Indians to shift uneasily on their
mounts. Fielding could hardly believe his massive good luck.
And he concluded that, all things considered, it would be
wise to ignore the cries of "Puss and Boots forever! Hip,
hip, hurrah!" coming from the back rank.
